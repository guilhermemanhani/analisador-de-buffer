[ORIGINAL

TO
THE
DUKE
OF
BUCCLEUGH.
MY
LORD,
The
first
idea
of
offering
my
LUSIAD
to
some
distinguished
personage,
inspired
the
earnest
wish,
that
it
might
be
accepted
by
the
illustrious
representative
of
that
family
under
which
my
father,
for
many
years,
discharged
the
duties
of
a
clergyman.
Both
the
late
Duke
of
BUCCLEUGH,
and
the
Earl
of
DALKEITH,
distinguished
him
by
particular
marks
of
their
favour;
and
I
must
have
forgotten
him,
if
I
could
have
wished
to
offer
the
first
Dedication
of
my
literary
labours
to
any
other
than
the
Duke
of
BUCCLEUGH.
I
am,
with
the
greatest
respect,
My
Lord,
Your
Grace's
most
devoted
And
most
obedient
humble
servant,
WILLIAM
JULIUS
MICKLE.
EDITOR'S
PREFACE.
In
undertaking,
at
the
publishers'
request,
the
function
of
editor
of
Mickle's
Lusiad,
I
have
compared
the
translation
with
the
original,
and,
in
some
places,
where
another
translation
seemed
preferable
to,
or
more
literal
than,
Mickle's,
I
have,
in
addition,
given
that
rendering
in
a
foot-note.
Moreover,
I
have
supplied
the
arguments
to
the
several
cantos,
given
a
few
more
explanatory
notes,
and
added
a
table
of
contents.
"The
late
ingenious
translator
of
the
Lusiad,"
says
Lord
Strangford,[1]
"has
portrayed
the
character,
and
narrated
the
misfortunes
of
our
poet,
in
a
manner
more
honourable
to
his
feelings
as
a
man
than
to
his
accuracy
in
point
of
biographical
detail.
It
is
with
diffidence
that
the
present
writer
essays
to
correct
his
errors;
but,
as
the
real
circumstances
of
the
life
of
Camoëns
are
mostly
to
be
found
in
his
own
minor
compositions,
with
which
Mr.
Mickle
was
unacquainted,
he
trusts
that
certain
information
will
atone
for
his
presumption."
As
Lord
Strangford
professes
to
have
better
and
more
recent
sources
of
information
regarding
the
illustrious,
but
unfortunate,
bard
of
Portugal,
I
make
no
apology
for
presenting
to
the
reader
an
abstract
of
his
lordship's
memoir.
Much
further
information
will
be
found,
however,
in
an
able
article
contained
in
No.
53
of
the
_Quarterly
Review_
for
July,
1822,
from
the
pen,
I
believe,
of
the
poet
Southey.
"The
family
of
Camoëns
was
illustrious,"
says
Lord
Strangford,
"and
originally
Spanish.
They
were
long
settled
at
Cadmon,
a
castle
in
Galicia,
from
which
they
probably
derived
their
patronymic
appellation.
However,
there
are
some
who
maintain
that
their
name
alluded
to
a
certain
wonderful
bird,[2]
whose
mischievous
sagacity
discovered
and
punished
the
smallest
deviation
from
conjugal
fidelity.
A
lady
of
the
house
of
Cadmon,
whose
conduct
had
been
rather
indiscreet,
demanded
to
be
tried
by
this
extraordinary
judge.
Her
innocence
was
proved,
and,
in
gratitude
to
the
being
who
had
restored
him
to
matrimonial
felicity,
the
contented
husband
adopted
his
name."
It
would
appear
that
in
a
dispute
between
the
families
of
Cadmon
and
De
Castera,
a
cavalier
of
the
latter
family
was
slain.
This
happened
in
the
fourteenth
century.
A
long
train
of
persecution
followed,
to
escape
which,
Ruy
de
Camoëns,
having
embraced
the
cause
of
Ferdinand,
removed
with
his
family
into
Portugal,
about
A.D.
1370.
His
son,
Vasco
de
Camoëns,
was
highly
distinguished
by
royal
favour,
and
had
the
honour
of
being
the
ancestor
of
our
poet,
who
descended
from
him
in
the
fourth
generation.
Luia
de
Camoëns,
the
author
of
the
Lusiad,
was
born
at
Lisbon
about
A.D.
1524.
His
misfortunes
began
with
his
birth--he
never
saw
a
father's
smile--for
Simon
Vasco
de
Camoëns
perished
by
shipwreck
in
the
very
year
which
gave
being
to
his
illustrious
son.
The
future
poet
was
sent
to
the
university
of
Coimbra--then
at
the
height
of
its
fame,--"and
maintained
there
by
the
provident
care
of
his
surviving
parent."
"Love,"
says
Lord
Strangford,
"is
very
nearly
allied
to
devotion,
and
it
was
in
the
exercise
of
the
latter,
that
Camoëns
was
introduced
to
the
knowledge
of
the
former.
In
the
Church
of
Christ's
Wounds
at
Lisbon,
on
11th
April,
1542,
Camoëns
first
beheld
Doña
Caterina
de
Atayde,
the
object
of
his
purest
and
earliest
attachment
...
and
it
was
not
long
before
Camoëns
enjoyed
an
opportunity
of
declaring
his
affection,
with
all
the
romantic
ardour
of
eighteen
and
of
a
poet."
The
peculiar
situation
of
the
lady,
as
one
of
the
maids
of
honour
to
the
queen,
imposed
a
restraint
upon
her
admirer
which
soon
became
intolerable;
and
he,
for
having
violated
the
sanctity
of
the
royal
precincts,
was
in
consequence
banished
from
the
court.
Whatever
may
have
been
the
nature
of
his
offence,
"it
furnished
a
pretext
to
the
young
lady's
relations
for
terminating
an
intercourse
which
worldly
considerations
rendered
highly
imprudent."
But
Love
consoled
his
votary:
his
mistress,
on
the
morning
of
his
departure,
confessed
the
secret
of
her
long-concealed
affection,
and
the
sighs
of
grief
were
soon
lost
in
those
of
mutual
delight.
The
hour
of
parting
was,
perhaps,
the
sweetest
of
our
poet's
existence.
Camoëns
removed
to
Santarem,
but
speedily
returned
to
Lisbon,
was
a
second
time
detected,
and
again
driven
into
exile.[3]
The
voice
of
Love
inspired
our
poet
"with
the
glorious
resolution
of
conquering
the
obstacles
which
fortune
had
placed
between
him
and
felicity."
He
obtained
permission,
therefore,
to
accompany
King
John
III.
in
an
expedition
then
fitting
out
against
the
Moors
in
Africa.
In
one
of
the
engagements
with
the
enemy
our
hero
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
"his
right
eye,
by
some
splinters
from
the
deck
of
the
vessel
in
which
he
was
stationed.
Many
of
his
most
pathetic
compositions
were
written
during
this
campaign,
and
the
toils
of
a
martial
life
were
sweetened
by
the
recollection
of
her
for
whose
sake
they
were
endured.
His
heroic
conduct
at
length
procured
his
recall
to
court,"
but
to
find,
alas,
that
his
mistress
was
no
more.
Disappointed
in
his
hope
of
obtaining
any
recognition
of
his
valiant
deeds,
he
now
resolved,
under
the
burning
sun
of
India,
to
seek
that
independence
which
his
own
country
denied.
"The
last
words
I
uttered,"
says
Camoëns,
"on
board
the
vessel
before
leaving,
were
those
of
Scipio:
'Ungrateful
country!
thou
shalt
not
even
possess
my
bones.'"
"Some,"
says
Lord
Strangford,
"attribute
his
departure
to
a
very
different
cause,
and
assert
that
he
quitted
his
native
shores
on
account
of
an
intrigue
in
which
he
was
detected
with
the
beautiful
wife
of
a
Portuguese
gentleman.
Perhaps,"
says
Lord
Strangford,
"this
story
may
not
be
wholly
unfounded."
On
his
arrival
in
India
he
contributed
by
his
bravery
to
the
success
of
an
expedition
carried
on
by
the
King
of
Cochin,
and
his
allies,
the
Portuguese,
against
the
Pimento
Islands;
and
in
the
following
year
(1555)
he
accompanied
Manuel
de
Vasconcelos
in
an
expedition
to
the
Red
Sea.
Here
he
explored
the
wild
regions
of
East
Africa,
and
stored
his
mind
with
ideas
of
scenery,
which
afterwards
formed
some
of
the
most
finished
pictures
of
the
Lusiad.
On
his
return
to
Goa,
Camoëns
devoted
his
whole
attention
to
the
completion
of
his
poem;
but
an
unfortunate
satire
which,
under
the
title
of
_Disparates
na
India_,
or
Follies
in
India,
he
wrote
against
the
vices
and
corruptions
of
the
Portuguese
authorities
in
Goa,
so
roused
the
indignation
of
the
viceroy
that
the
poet
was
banished
to
China.
Of
his
adventures
in
China,
and
the
temporary
prosperity
he
enjoyed
there,
while
he
held
the
somewhat
uncongenial
office
of
_Provedor
dos
defuntos_,
i.e.,
Trustee
for
deceased
persons,
Mickle
has
given
an
ample
account
in
the
introduction
to
the
Lusiad.
During
those
years
Camoëns
completed
his
poem,
about
half
of
which
was
written
before
he
left
Europe.
According
to
a
tradition,
not
improbable
in
itself,
he
composed
great
part
of
it
in
a
natural
grotto
which
commands
a
splendid
view
of
the
city
and
harbour
of
Macao.
An
engraving
of
it
may
be
seen
in
Onseley's
Oriental
Collections,
and
another
will
be
found
in
Sir
G.
Staunton's
Account
of
the
Embassy
to
China.
A
little
temple,
in
the
Chinese
style,
has
been
erected
upon
the
rock,
and
the
ground
around
it
has
been
ornamented
by
Mr.
Fitzhugh,
one
of
our
countrymen,
from
respect
to
the
memory
of
the
poet.
The
years
that
he
passed
in
Macao
were
probably
the
happiest
of
his
life.
Of
his
departure
for
Europe,
and
his
unfortunate
shipwreck
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
Meekhaun,[4]
in
Cochin
China,
Mickle
has
also
given
a
sufficient
account.
Lord
Strangford
has
related,
on
the
authority
of
Sousa,
that
while
our
poet
was
languishing
in
poverty
at
Lisbon,
"a
cavalier,
named
Ruy
de
Camera,
called
on
him
one
day,
asking
him
to
finish
for
him
a
poetical
version
of
the
seven
penitential
psalms.
Raising
his
head
from
his
wretched
pallet,
and
pointing
to
his
faithful
Javanese
attendant,
he
exclaimed,
'Alas,
when
I
was
a
poet,
I
was
young,
and
happy,
and
blest
with
the
love
of
ladies;
but
now
I
am
a
forlorn,
deserted
wretch.
See--there
stands
my
poor
Antonio,
vainly
supplicating
fourpence
to
purchase
a
little
coals--I
have
them
not
to
give
him.'
The
cavalier,
as
Sousa
relates,
closed
both
his
heart
and
his
purse,
and
quitted
the
room.
Such
were
the
grandees
of
Portugal."
Camoëns
sank
under
the
pressure
of
penury
and
disease,
and
died
in
an
alms-house,
early
in
1579,
and
was
buried
in
the
church
of
Sta.
Anna
of
the
Franciscan
Friars.
Over
his
grave
Gonzalo
Coutinho
placed
the
following
inscription:--
"HERE
LIES
LUIS
DE
CAMOËNS.
HE
EXCELLED
ALL
THE
POETS
OF
HIS
TIME.
HE
LIVED
POOR
AND
MISERABLE,
AND
HE
DIED
SO.
MDLXXIX."
The
translator
of
the
Lusiad
was
born,
in
1734,
at
Langholm,
in
Dumfriesshire,
where
his
father,
a
good
French
scholar,
was
the
Presbyterian
minister.
At
the
age
of
sixteen
William
Julius
Mickle
was
removed,
to
his
great
dislike,
from
school,
and
sent
into
the
counting-house
of
a
relation
of
his
mother's,
a
brewer,
where,
against
his
inclination,
he
remained
five
years.
He
subsequently,
for
family
reasons,
became
the
head
of
the
firm,
and
carried
on
the
business.
It
is
not
to
be
wondered
at,
however,
that
with
his
dislike
to
business
in
general
and
to
this
one
in
particular,
he
did
not
succeed;
and
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
cause
of
his
failure,
and
subsequent
pecuniary
embarrassments,
arose
from
his
having
devoted
those
hours
to
his
poetical
studies
which
should
have
been
dedicated
to
business.
Mickle
obtained
afterwards
the
appointment
of
corrector
of
the
Clarendon
Press
in
Oxford,
and
died
at
Wheatly,
in
Oxfordshire,
in
1789.
Southey
speaks
of
Mickle
(_Quarterly
Review_,
liii.
p.
29)
as
a
man
of
genius
who
had
ventured
upon
the
chance
of
living
by
his
literary
labours,
and
says
that
he
"did
not
over-rate
the
powers
which
he
was
conscious
of
possessing,
knew
that
he
could
rely
upon
himself
for
their
due
exertion,
and
had
sufficient
worldly
prudence
to
look
out
for
a
subject
which
was
likely
to
obtain
notice
and
patronage."
His
other
poems,
Pollio,
Sir
Martyn,
etc.,
with
the
exception
of
his
Cumnor
Hall,
are
not
held
in
high
estimation.
Describing
the
several
poetic
versions
of
the
Lusiad,
Mr.
Musgrave
says,[5]
of
Fanshaw's
version,
that
"its
language
is
antiquated,
and
in
many
instances
it
travesties
the
original,
and
seldom
long
sustains
the
tone
of
epic
gravity
suited
to
the
poem.
It
is,
however,"
says
he,
"more
faithful
than
the
translation
of
Mickle,
but
it
would
be
ungenerous,"
he
adds,
"to
dwell
on
the
paraphrastic
licences
which
abound
in
Mickle's
performance,
and
on
its
many
interpolations
and
omissions.
Mr.
Mickle
thought,
no
doubt,"
says
Musgrave,
"that
by
this
process
he
should
produce
a
poem
which
in
its
perusal
might
afford
a
higher
gratification.
Nor
am
I
prepared
to
say
that
by
all
readers
this
would
be
deemed
a
miscalculation.
Let
it
not
be
supposed,
however,
that
I
wish
to
detract
from
the
intrinsic
merit
of
his
translation.
It
is
but
an
act
of
justice
to
admit,
that
it
contains
many
passages
of
exquisite
beauty,
and
that
it
is
a
performance
which
discovers
much
genius,
a
cultivated
taste,
and
a
brilliant
imagination.
Many
parts
of
the
original
are
rendered
with
great
facility,
elegance,
and
fidelity.
In
poetical
elegance
I
presume
not
to
enter
into
competition
with
him."
For
his
own
performance
Musgrave
claims
the
merit
of
greater
fidelity
to
the
original;
but
in
respect
of
harmony,
in
true
poetic
grace,
and
sublimity
of
diction,
his
translation
will
bear
no
comparison
with
Mickle's
version;
for
even
Southey,
in
the
article
before
quoted,
though
very
hard
upon
his
interpolations,
admits
that,
"Mickle
was
a
man
of
genius
...
a
man
whom
we
admire
and
respect;
whose
memory
is
without
a
spot,
and
whose
name
will
live
among
the
English
poets."
(_Quarterly
Review_,
liii.
p.
29.)
It
only
remains
for
me
to
say,
that
in
order
to
place
the
reader
in
a
position
to
judge
of
the
merits
of
this
sublime
effort
of
genius,
I
have
distinguished
Mickle's
longer
interpolations
by
printing
them
in
Bk.
i.
p.
24,
in
_Italics_,
and
in
the
first
300
lines
of
Bk.
ix.
by
calling
the
attention
of
the
reader
to
the
interpolation
by
means
of
a
foot-note.
The
notes
are,
in
general,
left
as
written
by
the
translator,
except
in
some
cases
where
it
seemed
advisable
to
curtail
them.

THE
LIFE
OF
CAMOËNS,
BY
WILLIAM
JULIUS
MICKLE.
When
the
glory
of
the
arms
of
Portugal
had
reached
its
meridian
splendour,
Nature,
as
if
in
pity
of
the
literary
rudeness
of
that
nation,
produced
a
great
poet
to
record
the
numberless
actions
of
high
spirit
performed
by
his
countrymen.
Except
Osorius,
the
historians
of
Portugal
are
little
better
than
dry
journalists.
But
it
is
not
their
inelegance
which
rendered
the
poet
necessary.
It
is
the
peculiar
nature
of
poetry
to
give
a
colouring
to
heroic
actions,
and
to
express
indignation
against
breaches
of
honour,
in
a
spirit
which
at
once
seizes
the
heart
of
the
man
of
feeling,
and
carries
with
it
instantaneous
conviction.
The
brilliant
actions
of
the
Portuguese
form
the
great
hinge
which
opened
the
door
to
the
most
important
alterations
in
the
civil
history
of
mankind.
And
to
place
these
actions
in
the
light
and
enthusiasm
of
poetry--that
enthusiasm
which
particularly
assimilates
the
youthful
breast
to
its
own
fires--was
Luis
de
Camoëns
the
poet
of
Portugal,
born.
Different
cities
have
claimed
the
honour
of
his
birth.
But
according
to
N.
Antonio,
and
Manuel
Correa,
his
intimate
friend,
this
event
happened
at
Lisbon
in
1517.[6]
His
family
was
of
considerable
note,
and
originally
Spanish.
In
1370
Vasco
Perez
de
Caamans,
disgusted
at
the
court
of
Castile,
fled
to
that
of
Lisbon,
where
King
Ferdinand
immediately
admitted
him
into
his
council,
and
gave
him
the
lordships
of
Sardoal,
Punnete,
Marano,
Amendo,
and
other
considerable
lands;
a
certain
proof
of
the
eminence
of
his
rank
and
abilities.
In
the
war
for
the
succession,
which
broke
out
on
the
death
of
Ferdinand,
Caamans
sided
with
the
King
of
Castile,
and
was
killed
in
the
battle
of
Aljabarota.
But
though
John
I.,
the
victor,
seized
a
great
part
of
his
estate,
his
widow,
the
daughter
of
Gonsalo
Tereyro,
grand
master
of
the
Order
of
Christ,
and
general
of
the
Portuguese
army,
was
not
reduced
beneath
her
rank.
She
had
three
sons,
who
took
the
name
of
Camoëns.
The
family
of
the
eldest
intermarried
with
the
first
nobility
of
Portugal,
and
even,
according
to
Castera,
with
the
blood
royal.
But
the
family
of
the
second
brother,
whose
fortune
was
slender,
had
the
superior
honour
to
produce
the
author
of
the
Lusiad.
Early
in
life
the
misfortunes
of
the
poet
began.
In
his
infancy,
Simon
Vaz
de
Camoëns,
his
father,
commander
of
a
vessel,
was
shipwrecked
at
Goa,
where,
with
his
life,
the
greatest
part
of
his
fortune
was
lost.
His
mother,
however,
Anne
de
Macedo
of
Santarem,
provided
for
the
education
of
her
son
Luis,
at
the
University
of
Coimbra.
What
he
acquired
there
his
works
discover;
an
intimacy
with
the
classics,
equal
to
that
of
a
Scaliger,
but
directed
by
the
taste
of
a
Milton
or
a
Pope.
When
he
left
the
university
he
appeared
at
court.
He
was
a
polished
scholar
and
very
handsome,[7]
possessing
a
most
engaging
mien
and
address,
with
the
finest
complexion,
which,
added
to
the
natural
ardour
and
gay
vivacity
of
his
deposition,
rendered
him
an
accomplished
gentleman.
Courts
are
the
scenes
of
intrigue,
and
intrigue
was
fashionable
at
Lisbon.
But
the
particulars
of
the
amours
of
Camoëns
rest
unknown.
This
only
appears:
he
had
aspired
above
his
rank,
for
he
was
banished
from
the
court;
and
in
several
of
his
sonnets
he
ascribes
this
misfortune
to
love.
He
now
retired
to
his
mother's
friends
at
Santarem.
Here
he
renewed
his
studies,
and
began
his
poem
on
the
discovery
of
India.
John
III.
at
this
time
prepared
an
armament
against
Africa.
Camoëns,
tired
of
his
inactive,
obscure
life,
went
to
Ceuta
in
this
expedition,
and
greatly
distinguished
his
valour
in
several
_rencontres_.
In
a
naval
engagement
with
the
Moors
in
the
Straits
of
Gibraltar,
Camoëns,
in
the
conflict
of
boarding,
where
he
was
among
the
foremost,
lost
his
right
eye.
Yet
neither
the
hurry
of
actual
service,
nor
the
dissipation
of
the
camp,
could
stifle
his
genius.
He
continued
his
_Lusiadas_;
and
several
of
his
most
beautiful
sonnets
were
written
in
Africa,
while,
as
he
expresses
it,
"One
hand
the
pen,
and
ant
the
sword
employ'd."
The
fame
of
his
valour
had
now
reached
the
Court,
and
he
obtained
permission
to
return
to
Lisbon.
But
while
he
solicited
an
establishment
which
he
had
merited
in
the
ranks
of
battle,
the
malignity
of
evil
tongues
(as
he
calls
it
in
one
of
his
letters)
was
injuriously
poured
upon
him.
Though
the
bloom
of
his
early
youth
was
effaced
by
several
years
residence
under
the
scorching
sky
of
Africa,
and
though
altered
by
the
loss
of
an
eye,
his
presence
gave
uneasiness
to
the
gentlemen
of
some
families
of
the
first
rank
where
he
had
formerly
visited.
Jealousy
is
the
characteristic
of
the
Spanish
and
Portuguese;
its
resentment
knows
no
bounds,
and
Camoëns
now
found
it
prudent
to
banish
himself
from
his
native
country.
Accordingly,
in
1553
he
hailed
for
India,
with
a
resolution
never
to
return.
As
the
ship
left
the
Tagus
he
exclaimed,
in
the
words
of
the
sepulchral
monument
of
Scipio
Africanus,
"_Ingrata
patria,
non
possidebis
ossa
mea!_"
(Ungrateful
country,
thou
shalt
not
possess
my
bones!)
But
he
knew
not
what
evils
in
the
East
would
awaken
the
remembrance
of
his
native
fields.
When
Camoëns
arrived
in
India,
an
expedition
was
ready
to
sail
to
revenge
the
King
of
Cochin
on
the
King
of
Pimenta.
Without
any
rest
on
shore
after
his
long
voyage,
he
joined
this
armament,
and,
in
the
conquest
of
the
Alagada
Islands,
displayed
his
usual
bravery.
But
his
modesty,
perhaps,
is
his
greatest
praise.
In
a
sonnet
he
mentions
this
expedition:
"We
went
to
punish
the
King
of
Pimenta,"
says
he,
"_e
succedeones
bem_"
(and
we
succeeded
well).
When
it
is
considered
that
the
poet
bore
no
inconsiderable
share
in
the
victory,
no
ode
can
conclude
more
elegantly,
more
happily
than
this.
In
the
year
following,
he
attended
Manuel
de
Vasconcello
in
an
expedition
to
the
Red
Sea.
Here,
says
Faria,
as
Camoëns
had
no
use
for
his
sword,
he
employed
his
pen.
Nor
was
his
activity
confined
to
the
fleet
or
camp.
He
visited
Mount
Felix,
and
the
adjacent
inhospitable
regions
of
Africa,
which
he
so
strongly
pictures
in
the
Lusiad,
and
in
one
of
his
little
pieces,
where
he
laments
the
absence
of
his
mistress.
When
he
returned
to
Goa,
he
enjoyed
a
tranquility
which
enabled
him
to
bestow
his
attention
on
his
epic
poem.
But
this
serenity
was
interrupted,
perhaps
by
his
own
imprudence.
He
wrote
some
satires
which
gave
offence,
and
by
order
of
the
viceroy,
Francisco
Barreto,
he
was
banished
to
China.
Men
of
poor
abilities
are
more
conscious
of
their
embarrassment
and
errors
than
is
commonly
believed.
When
men
of
this
kind
are
in
power,
they
affect
great
solemnity;
and
every
expression
of
the
most
distant
tendency
to
lessen
their
dignity
is
held
as
the
greatest
of
crimes.
Conscious,
also,
how
severely
the
man
of
genius
can
hurt
their
interest,
they
bear
an
instinctive
antipathy
against
him,
are
uneasy
even
in
his
company,
and,
on
the
slightest
pretence,
are
happy
to
drive
him
from
them.
Camoëns
was
thus
situated
at
Goa;
and
never
was
there
a
fairer
field
for
satire
than
the
rulers
of
India
at
that
time
afforded.
Yet,
whatever
esteem
the
prudence
of
Camoëns
may
lose
in
our
idea,
the
nobleness
of
his
disposition
will
doubly
gain.
And,
so
conscious
was
he
of
his
real
integrity
and
innocence,
that
in
one
of
his
sonnets
he
wishes
no
other
revenge
on
Barreto
than
that
the
cruelty
of
his
exile
should
ever
be
remembered.[8]
The
accomplishments
and
manners
of
Camoëns
soon
found
him
friends,
though
under
the
disgrace
of
banishment.
He
was
appointed
Commissary
of
the
estates
of
deceased
persons,
in
the
island
of
Macao,
a
Portuguese
settlement
on
the
coast
of
China.
Here
he
continued
his
Lusiad;
and
here,
also,
after
five
years
residence,
he
acquired
a
fortune,
though
small,
yet
equal
to
his
wishes.
Don
Constantine
de
Braganza
was
now
Viceroy
of
India;
and
Camoëns,
desirous
to
return
to
Goa,
resigned
his
charge.
In
a
ship,
freighted
by
himself,
he
set
sail,
but
was
shipwrecked
in
the
gulf
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
Meekhaun,
in
Cochin
China.
All
he
had
acquired
was
lost
in
the
waves:
his
poems,
which
he
held
in
one
hand,
while
he
swam
with
the
other,
were
all
he
found
himself
possessed
of
when
he
stood
friendless
on
the
unknown
shore.
But
the
natives
gave
him
a
most
humane
reception;
this
he
has
immortalized
in
the
prophetic
song
in
the
tenth
Lusiad;[9]
and
in
the
seventh
he
tells
us
that
here
he
lost
the
wealth
which
satisfied
his
wishes.
_Agora
da
esperança
ja
adquirida,
etc._
"Now
blest
with
all
the
wealth
fond
hope
could
crave,
Soon
I
beheld
that
wealth
beneath
the
wave
For
ever
lost;----
My
life
like
Judah's
Heaven-doom'd
king
of
yore
By
miracle
prolong'd."
On
the
banks
of
the
Meekhaun,
he
wrote
his
beautiful
paraphrase
of
the
137th
Psalm,
where
the
Jews,
in
the
finest
strain
of
poetry,
are
represented
as
hanging
their
harps
on
the
willows
by
the
rivers
of
Babylon,
and
weeping
their
exile
from
their
native
country.
Here
Camoëns
continued
some
time,
till
an
opportunity
offered
to
carry
him
to
Goa.
When
he
arrived
at
that
city,
Don
Constantine
de
Braganza,
the
viceroy,
whose
characteristic
was
politeness,
admitted
him
into
intimate
friendship,
and
Camoëns
was
happy
till
Count
Redondo
assumed
the
government.
Those
who
had
formerly
procured
the
banishment
of
the
satirist
were
silent
while
Constantine
was
in
power.
But
now
they
exerted
all
their
arts
against
him.
Redondo,
when
he
entered
on
office,
pretended
to
be
the
friend
of
Camoëns;
yet,
with
the
most
unfeeling
indifference,
he
suffered
the
innocent
man
to
be
thrown
into
the
common
prison.
After
all
the
delay
of
bringing
witnesses,
Camoëns,
in
a
public
trial,
fully
refuted
every
accusation
against
his
conduct
while
commissary
at
Macao,
and
his
enemies
were
loaded
with
ignominy
and
reproach.
But
Camoëns
had
some
creditors;
and
these
detained
him
in
prison
a
considerable
time,
till
the
gentlemen
of
Goa
began
to
be
ashamed
that
a
man
of
his
singular
merit
should
experience
such
treatment
among
them.
He
was
set
at
liberty;
and
again
he
assumed
the
profession
of
arms,
and
received
the
allowance
of
a
gentleman-volunteer,
a
character
at
that
time
common
in
Portuguese
India.
Soon
after,
Pedro
Barreto
(appointed
governor
of
the
fort
of
Sofála),
by
high
promises,
allured
the
poet
to
attend
him
thither.
The
governor
of
a
distant
fort,
in
a
barbarous
country,
shares
in
some
measure
the
fate
of
an
exile.
Yet,
though
the
only
motive
of
Barreto
was,
in
this
unpleasant
situation,
to
retain
the
conversation
of
Camoëns
at
his
table,
it
was
his
least
care
to
render
the
life
of
his
guest
agreeable.
Chagrined
with
his
treatment,
and
a
considerable
time
having
elapsed
in
vain
dependence
upon
Barreto,
Camoëns
resolved
to
return
to
his
native
country.
A
ship,
on
the
homeward
voyage,
at
this
time
touched
at
Sofála,
and
several
gentlemen[10]
who
were
on
board
were
desirous
that
Camoëns
should
accompany
them.
But
this
the
governor
ungenerously
endeavoured
to
prevent,
and
charged
him
with
a
debt
for
board.
Anthony
de
Cabral,
however,
and
Hector
de
Sylveyra,
paid
the
demand,
and
Camoëns,
says
Faria,
and
the
honour
of
Barreto
were
sold
together.
After
an
absence
of
sixteen
years,
Camoëns,
in
1569,
returned
to
Lisbon,
unhappy
even
in
his
arrival,
for
the
pestilence
then
raged
in
that
city,
and
prevented
his
publishing
for
three
years.
At
last,
in
1572,
he
printed
his
Lusiad,
which,
in
the
opening
of
the
first
book,
in
a
most
elegant
turn
of
compliment,
he
addressed
to
his
prince,
King
Sebastian,
then
in
his
eighteenth
year.
The
king,
says
the
French
translator,
was
so
pleased
with
his
merit,
that
he
gave
the
author
a
pension
of
4000
reals,
on
condition
that
he
should
reside
at
court.
But
this
salary,
says
the
same
writer,
was
withdrawn
by
Cardinal
Henry,
who
succeeded
to
the
crown
of
Portugal,
lost
by
Sebastian
at
the
battle
of
Alcazar.
But
this
story
of
the
pension
is
very
doubtful.
Correa
and
other
contemporary
authors
do
not
mention
it,
though
some
late
writers
have
given
credit
to
it.
If
Camoëns,
however,
had
a
pension,
it
is
highly
probable
that
Henry
deprived
him
of
it.
While
Sebastian
was
devoted
to
the
chase,
his
grand-uncle,
the
cardinal,
presided
at
the
council
board,
and
Camoëns,
in
his
address
to
the
king,
which
closes
the
Lusiad,
advises
him
to
exclude
the
clergy
from
State
affairs.
It
was
easy
to
see
that
the
cardinal
was
here
intended.
And
Henry,
besides,
was
one
of
those
statesmen
who
can
perceive
no
benefit
resulting
to
the
public
from
elegant
literature.
But
it
ought
also
to
be
added
in
completion
of
his
character,
that
under
the
narrow
views
and
weak
hands
of
this
Henry,
the
kingdom
of
Portugal
fell
into
utter
ruin;
and
on
his
death,
which
closed
a
short
inglorious
reign,
the
crown
of
Lisbon,
after
a
faint
struggle,
was
annexed
to
that
of
Spain.
Such
was
the
degeneracy
of
the
Portuguese,
a
degeneracy
lamented
in
vain
by
Camoëns,
whose
observation
of
it
was
imputed
to
him
as
a
crime.
Though
the
great[11]
patron
of
theological
literature--a
species
the
reverse
of
that
of
Camoëns--certain
it
is,
that
the
author
of
the
Lusiad
was
utterly
neglected
by
Henry,
under
whose
inglorious
reign
he
died
in
all
the
misery
of
poverty.
By
some,
it
is
said,
he
died
in
an
almshouse.
It
appears,
however,
that
he
had
not
even
the
certainty
of
subsistence
which
these
houses
provide.
He
had
a
black
servant,
who
had
grown
old
with
him,
and
who
had
long
experienced
his
master's
humanity.
This
grateful
dependant,
a
native
of
Java,
who,
according
to
some
writers,
saved
his
master's
life
in
the
unhappy
shipwreck
where
he
lost
his
effects,
begged
in
the
streets
of
Lisbon
for
the
only
man
in
Portugal
on
whom
God
had
bestowed
those
talents
which
have
a
tendency
to
erect
the
spirit
of
a
downward
age.
To
the
eye
of
a
careful
observer,
the
fate
of
Camoëns
throws
great
light
on
that
of
his
country,
and
will
appear
strictly
connected
with
it.
The
same
ignorance,
the
same
degenerate
spirit,
which
suffered
Camoëns
to
depend
on
his
share
of
the
alms
begged
in
the
streets
by
his
old
hoary
servant--the
same
spirit
which
caused
this,
sank
the
kingdom
of
Portugal
into
the
most
abject
vassalage
ever
experienced
by
a
conquered
nation.
While
the
grandees
of
Portugal
were
blind
to
the
ruin
which
impended
over
them,
Camoëns
beheld
it
with
a
pungency
of
grief
which
hastened
his
end.
In
one
of
his
letters
he
has
these
remarkable
words,
"_Em
fim
accaberey
à
vida,
e
verràm
todos
que
fuy
afeiçoada
a
minho
patria_,"
etc.--"I
am
ending
the
course
of
my
life,
the
world
will
witness
how
I
have
loved
my
country.
I
have
returned,
not
only
to
die
in
her
bosom,
but
to
die
with
her."
In
another
letter,
written
a
little
before
his
death,
he
thus,
yet
with
dignity,
complains,
"Who
has
seen
on
so
small
a
theatre
as
my
poor
bed,
such
a
representation
of
the
disappointments
of
Fortune.
And
I,
as
if
she
could
not
herself
subdue
me,
I
have
yielded
and
become
of
her
party;
for
it
were
wild
audacity
to
hope
to
surmount
such
accumulated
evils."
In
this
unhappy
situation,
in
1579,
in
his
sixty-second
year,
the
year
after
the
fatal
defeat
of
Don
Sebastian,
died
Luis
de
Camoëns,
the
greatest
literary
genius
ever
produced
by
Portugal;
in
martial
courage
and
spirit
of
honour
nothing
inferior
to
her
greatest
heroes.
And
in
a
manner
suitable
to
the
poverty
in
which
he
died
was
he
buried.
Soon
after,
however,
many
epitaphs
honoured
his
memory;
the
greatness
of
his
merit
was
universally
confessed,
and
his
Lusiad
was
translated
into
various
languages.[12]
Nor
ought
it
to
be
omitted,
that
the
man
so
miserably
neglected
by
the
weak
king
Henry,
was
earnestly
enquired
after
by
Philip
of
Spain
when
he
assumed
the
crown
of
Lisbon.
When
Philip
heard
that
Camoëns
was
dead,
both
his
words
and
his
countenance
expressed
his
disappointment
and
grief.
From
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life,
and
from
that
spirit
which
glows
throughout
the
Lusiad,
it
evidently
appears
that
the
courage
and
manners
of
Camoëns
flowed
from
true
greatness
and
dignity
of
soul.
Though
his
polished
conversation
was
often
courted
by
the
great,
he
appears
so
distant
from
servility
that
his
imprudence
in
this
respect
is
by
some
highly
blamed.
Yet
the
instances
of
it
by
no
means
deserve
that
severity
of
censure
with
which
some
writers
have
condemned
him.
Unconscious
of
the
feelings
of
a
Camoëns,
they
knew
not
that
a
carelessness
in
securing
the
smiles
of
fortune,
and
an
open
honesty
of
indignation,
are
almost
inseparable
from
the
enthusiasm
of
fine
imagination.
The
truth
is,
the
man
possessed
of
true
genius
feels
his
greatest
happiness
in
the
pursuits
and
excursions
of
the
mind,
and
therefore
makes
an
estimate
of
things
very
different
from
that
of
him
whose
unremitting
attention
is
devoted
to
his
external
interest.
The
profusion
of
Camoëns
is
also
censured.
Had
he
dissipated
the
wealth
he
acquired
at
Macao,
his
profusion
indeed
had
been
criminal;
but
it
does
not
appear
that
he
ever
enjoyed
any
other
opportunity
of
acquiring
independence.
But
Camoëns
was
unfortunate,
and
the
unfortunate
man
is
viewed--
"Through
the
dim
shade
his
fate
casts
o'er
him:
A
shade
that
spreads
its
evening
darkness
o'er
His
brightest
virtues,
while
it
shows
his
foibles
Crowding
and
obvious
as
the
midnight
stars,
Which,
in
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
Never
had
been
descried."
Yet,
after
the
strictest
discussion,
when
all
the
causes
are
weighed
together,
the
misfortunes
of
Camoëns
will
appear
the
fault
and
disgrace
of
his
age
and
country,
and
not
of
the
man.
His
talents
would
have
secured
him
an
apartment
in
the
palace
of
Augustus,
but
such
talents
are
a
curse
to
their
possessor
in
an
illiterate
nation.
In
a
beautiful,
digressive
exclamation
at
the
end
of
the
Lusiad,
he
affords
us
a
striking
view
of
the
neglect
which
he
experienced.
Having
mentioned
how
the
greatest
heroes
of
antiquity
revered
and
cherished
the
muse,
he
thus
characterizes
the
nobility
of
his
own
age
and
country.
"Alas!
on
Tago's
hapless
shore
alone
The
muse
is
slighted,
and
her
charms
unknown;
For
this,
no
Virgil
here
attunes
the
lyre,
No
Homer
here
awakes
the
hero's
fire;
Unheard,
in
vain
their
native
poet
sings,
And
cold
neglect
weighs
dawn
the
muse's
wings."
In
such
an
age,
and
among
such
a
barbarous
nobility,
what
but
wretched
neglect
could
be
the
fate
of
a
Camoëns!
After
all,
however,
if
he
was
imprudent
on
his
first
appearance
at
the
court
of
John
III.;
if
the
honesty
of
his
indignation
led
him
into
great
imprudence,
as
certainly
it
did,
when
at
Goa
he
satirised
the
viceroy
and
the
first
persons
in
power;
yet
let
it
also
be
remembered,
that
"The
gifts
of
imagination
bring
the
heaviest
task
upon
the
vigilance
of
reason;
and
to
bear
those
faculties
with
unerring
rectitude,
or
invariable
propriety,
requires
a
degree
of
firmness
and
of
cool
attention,
which
doth
not
always
attend
the
higher
gifts
of
the
mind.
Yet,
difficult
as
nature
herself
seems
to
have
rendered
the
task
of
regularity
to
genius,
it
is
the
supreme
consolation
of
dullness
and
of
folly
to
point
with
Gothic
triumph
to
those
excesses
which
are
the
overflowings
of
faculties
they
never
enjoyed.
Perfectly
unconscious
that
they
are
indebted
to
their
stupidity
for
the
consistency
of
their
conduct,
they
plume
themselves
on
an
imaginary
virtue
which
has
its
origin
in
what
is
really
their
disgrace.--Let
such,
if
such
dare
approach
the
shrine
of
Camoëns,
withdraw
to
a
respectful
distance;
and
should
they
behold
the
ruins
of
genius,
or
the
weakness
of
an
exalted
mind,
let
them
be
taught
to
lament
that
nature
has
left
the
noblest
of
her
works
imperfect."[13]
DISSERTATION
ON
THE
LUSIAD,
AND
ON
EPIC
POETRY,
BY
THE
TRANSLATOR.
When
Voltaire
was
in
England,
previous
to
his
publication
of
his
Henriade,
he
published
in
English
an
essay
on
the
epic
poetry
of
the
European
nations.
In
this
he
both
highly
praised,
and
severely
attacked,
the
Lusiad.
In
his
French
editions
of
this
essay,
he
has
made
various
alterations,
at
different
times,
in
the
article
on
Camoëns.
It
is
not,
however,
improper
to
premise,
that
some
most
amazing
falsities
will
be
here
detected;
the
gross
misrepresentation
of
every
objection
refuted;
and
demonstration
brought,
that
when
Voltaire
wrote
his
English
essay,
his
knowledge
of
the
Lusiad
was
entirely
borrowed
from
the
bold,
harsh,
unpoetical
version
of
Fanshaw.
"While
Trissino,"
says
Voltaire,
"was
clearing
away
the
rubbish
in
Italy,
which
barbarity
and
ignorance
had
heaped
up
for
ten
centuries
in
the
way
of
the
arts
and
sciences,
Camoëns,
in
Portugal,
steered
a
new
course,
and
acquired
a
reputation
which
lasts
still
among
his
countrymen
who
pay
as
much
respect
to
his
memory
as
the
English
to
Milton."
Among
other
passages
of
the
Lusiad
which
he
criticises
is
that
where
"Adamastor,
the
giant
of
the
Cape
of
Storms,
appears
to
them,
walking
in
the
depth
of
the
sea;
his
head
reaches
to
the
clouds;
the
storms,
the
winds,
the
thunders,
and
the
lightnings
hang
about
him;
his
arms
are
extended
over
the
waves.
It
is
the
guardian
of
that
foreign
ocean,
unploughed
before
by
any
ship.
He
complains
of
being
obliged
to
submit
to
fate,
and
to
the
audacious
undertaking
of
the
Portuguese,
and
foretells
them
all
the
misfortunes
they
must
undergo
in
the
Indies.
I
believe
that
such
a
fiction
would
be
thought
noble
and
proper
in
all
ages,
and
in
all
nations.
"There
is
another,
which
perhaps
would
have
pleased
the
Italians
as
well
as
the
Portuguese,
but
no
other
nation
besides:
it
is
the
enchanted
island,
called
the
Island
of
Bliss,
which
the
fleet
finds
in
its
way
home,
just
rising
from
the
sea,
for
their
comfort,
and
for
their
reward.
Camoëns
describes
that
place,
as
Tasso
some
years
after
depicted
his
island
of
Armida.
There
a
supernatural
power
brings
in
all
the
beauties,
and
presents
all
the
pleasures
which
nature
can
afford,
and
the
heart
may
wish
for;
a
goddess,
enamoured
with
Vasco
de
Gama,
carries
him
to
the
top
of
a
high
mountain,
from
whence
she
shows
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth,
and
foretells
the
fate
of
Portugal.
"After
Camoëns
hath
given
loose
to
his
fancy,
in
the
description
of
the
pleasures
which
Gama
and
his
crew
enjoyed
in
the
island,
he
takes
care
to
inform
the
reader
that
he
ought
to
understand
by
this
fiction
nothing
but
the
satisfaction
which
the
virtuous
man
feels,
and
the
glory
which
accrues
to
him,
by
the
practice
of
virtue;
but
the
best
excuse
for
such
an
invention
is
the
charming
style
in
which
it
is
delivered
(if
we
may
believe
the
Portuguese),
for
the
beauty
of
the
elocution
sometimes
makes
amends
for
the
faults
of
the
poet,
as
the
colouring
of
Rubens
makes
some
defects
in
his
figures
pass
unregarded.
"There
is
_another_
kind
of
machinery
continued
throughout
all
the
poem,
which
nothing
can
excuse;
that
is,
an
injudicious
mixture
of
the
heathen
gods
with
our
religion.
Gama
in
a
storm
addresses
his
prayers
to
Christ,
but
it
is
Venus
who
comes
to
his
relief;
the
heroes
are
Christians,
and
the
poet
heathen.
The
main
design
which
the
Portuguese
are
supposed
to
have
(next
to
promoting
their
trade)
is
to
propagate
Christianity;
yet
Jupiter,
Bacchus,
and
Venus,
have
in
their
hands
all
the
management
of
the
voyage.
So
incongruous
a
machinery
casts
a
blemish
upon
the
whole
poem;
yet
it
shows
at
the
same
time
how
prevailing
are
its
beauties
since
the
Portuguese
like
it
with
all
its
faults."
The
Lusiad,
says
Voltaire,
contains
"a
sort
of
epic
poetry
unheard
of
before.
No
heroes
are
wounded
a
thousand
different
ways;
no
woman
enticed
away,
and
the
world
overturned
for
her
cause."
But
the
very
want
of
these,
in
place
of
supporting
the
objection
intended
by
Voltaire,
points
out
the
happy
judgment
and
peculiar
excellence
of
Camoëns.
If
Homer
has
given
us
all
the
fire
and
hurry
of
battles,
he
has
also
given
us
all
the
uninteresting,
tiresome
detail.
What
reader
but
must
be
tired
with
the
deaths
of
a
thousand
heroes,
who
are
never
mentioned
before,
nor
afterwards,
in
the
poem.
Yet,
in
every
battle
we
are
wearied
out
with
such
_Gazette_-returns
of
the
slain
and
wounded
as--
"Hector
Priamides
when
Zeus
him
glory
gave,
Assæus
first,
Autonoüs,
he
slew;
Ophites,
Dolops,
Klytis'
son
beside;
Opheltius
also,
Agelaüs
too,
Æsymnus,
and
the
battle-bide
Hippónoüs,
chiefs
on
Danaian
side,
And
then,
the
multitude."
HOMER'S
Iliad,
bk.
xi.
299,
et
seq.,
(W.
G.
T.
BARTER'S
translation.)
And
corresponding
to
it
is
Virgil's
Æneid,
bk.
x.
line
747,
et
seq.:--
"By
Cædicus
Alcathoüs
was
slain;
Sacrator
laid
Hydaspes
on
the
plain;
Orsès
the
strong
to
greater
strength
must
yield,
He,
with
Parthenius,
were
by
Rapo
killed.
Then
brave
Messapus
Ericetès
slew,
Who
from
Lycaón's
blood
his
lineage
drew."
DRYDEN'S
version.
With,
such
catalogues
is
every
battle
extended;
and
what
can
be
more
tiresome
than
such
uninteresting
descriptions,
and
their
imitations!
If
the
idea
of
the
battle
be
raised
by
such
enumeration,
still
the
copy
and
original
are
so
near
each
other
that
they
can
never
please
in
two
separate
poems.
Nor
are
the
greater
part
of
the
battles
of
the
Æneid
much
more
distant
than
those
of
the
Iliad.
Though
Virgil
with
great
art
has
introduced
a
Camilla,
a
Pallas,
and
a
Lausus,
still,
in
many
particulars,
and
in
the
action
upon
the
whole,
there
is
such
a
sameness
with
the
Iliad,
that
the
learned
reader
of
the
Æneid
is
deprived
of
the
pleasure
inspired
by
originality.
If
the
man
of
taste,
however,
will
be
pleased
to
mark
how
the
genius
of
a
Virgil
has
managed
a
war
after
Homer,
he
will
certainly
be
tired
with
a
dozen
epic
poems
in
the
same
style.
Where
the
siege
of
a
town
and
battles
are
the
subject
of
an
epic,
there
will,
of
necessity,
in
the
characters
and
circumstances,
be
a
resemblance
to
Homer;
and
such
poem
must
therefore
want
originality.
Happily
for
Tasso,
the
variation
of
manners,
and
his
masterly
superiority
over
Homer
in
describing
his
duels,
has
given
to
his
Jerusalem
an
air
of
novelty.
Yet,
with
all
the
difference
between
Christian
and
pagan
heroes,
we
have
a
Priam,
an
Agamemnon,
an
Achilles,
etc.,
armies
slaughtered,
and
a
city
besieged.
In
a
word,
we
have
a
handsome
copy
of
the
Iliad
in
the
Jerusalem
Delivered.
If
some
imitations,
however,
have
been
successful,
how
many
other
epics
of
ancient
and
modern
times
have
hurried
down
the
stream
of
oblivion!
Some
of
their
authors
had
poetical
merit,
but
the
fault
was
in
the
choice
of
their
subjects.
So
fully
is
the
strife
of
war
exhausted
by
Homer,
that
Virgil
and
Tasso
could
add
to
it
but
little
novelty;
no
wonder,
therefore,
that
so
many
epics
on
battles
and
sieges
have
been
suffered
to
sink
into
utter
neglect.
Camoëns,
perhaps,
did
not
weigh
these
circumstances,
but
the
strength
of
his
poetical
genius
directed
him.
He
could
not
but
feel
what
it
was
to
read
Virgil
after
Homer;
and
the
original
turn
and
force
of
his
mind
led
him
from
the
beaten
track
of
Helen's
and
Lavinia's,
Achilles's
and
Hector's
sieges
and
slaughters,
where
the
hero
hews
down,
and
drives
to
flight,
whole
armies
with
his
own
sword.
Camoëns
was
the
first
who
wooed
the
modern
Epic
Muse,
and
she
gave
him
the
wreath
of
a
first
lover;
a
sort
of
epic
poetry
unheard
of
before;
or,
as
Voltaire
calls
it,
_une
nouvelle
espèce
d'epopée_;
and
the
grandest
subject
it
is
(of
profane
history)
which
the
world
has
ever
beheld.[14]
A
voyage
esteemed
too
great
for
man
to
dare;
the
adventures
of
this
voyage
through
unknown
oceans
deemed
unnavigable;
the
eastern
world
happily
discovered,
and
for
ever
indissolubly
joined
and
given
to
the
western;
the
grand
Portuguese
empire
in
the
East
founded;
the
humanization
of
mankind,
and
universal
commerce
the
consequence!
What
are
the
adventures
of
an
old,
fabulous
hero's
arrival
in
Britain,
what
are
Greece
and
Latium
in
arms
for
a
woman
compared
to
this!
Troy
is
in
ashes,
and
even
the
Roman
empire
is
no
more.
But
the
effects
of
the
voyage,
adventures,
and
bravery
of
the
hero
of
the
Lusiad
will
be
felt
and
beheld,
and
perhaps
increase
in
importance,
while
the
world
shall
remain.
Happy
in
his
choice,
happy
also
was
the
genius
of
Camoëns
in
the
method
of
pursuing
his
subject.
He
has
not,
like
Tasso,
given
it
a
total
appearance
of
fiction;
nor
has
he,
like
Lucan,
excluded
allegory
and
poetical
machinery.
Whether
he
intended
it
or
not
(for
his
genius
was
sufficient
to
suggest
its
propriety),
the
judicious
precept
of
Petronius[15]
is
the
model
of
the
Lusiad.
That
elegant
writer
proposes
a
poem
on
the
civil
war,
and
no
poem,
ancient
or
modern,
merits
the
character
there
sketched
out
in
any
degree
comparative
to
the
Lusiad.
A
truth
of
history
is
preserved;
yet,
what
is
improper
for
the
historian,
the
ministry
of
Heaven
is
employed,
and
the
free
spirit
of
poetry
throws
itself
into
fictions
which
makes
the
whole
appear
as
an
effusion
of
prophetic
fury,
and
not
like
a
rigid
detail
of
facts,
given
under
the
sanction
of
witnesses.
Contrary
to
Lucan,
who,
in
the
above
rules,
drawn
from
the
nature
of
poetry,
is
severely
condemned
by
Petronius,
Camoëns
conducts
his
poem
_per
ambages
Deorumque
ministeria_.
The
apparition,
which
in
the
night
hovers
athwart
the
fleet
near
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope,
is
the
grandest
fiction
in
human
composition;
the
invention
his
own!
In
the
Island
of
Venus,
the
use
of
which
fiction
in
an
epic
poem
is
also
his
own,
he
has
given
the
completest
assemblage
of
all
the
flowers
which
have
ever
adorned
the
bowers
of
love.
And,
never
was
the
_furentis
animi
vaticinatio_
more
conspicuously
displayed
than
in
the
prophetic
song,
the
view
of
the
spheres,
and
the
globe
of
the
earth.
Tasso's
imitation
of
the
Island
of
Venus
is
not
equal
to
the
original;
and,
though
"Virgil's
myrtles[16]
dropping
blood
are
nothing
to
Tasso's
enchanted
forest,"
what
are
all
Ismeno's
enchantments
to
the
grandeur
and
horror
of
the
appearance,
prophecy,
and
vanishment
of
the
spectre
of
Camoëns![17]
It
has
long
been
agreed
among
critics,
that
the
solemnity
of
religious
observances
gives
great
dignity
to
the
historical
narrative
of
epic
poetry.
Camoëns,
in
the
embarkation
of
the
fleet,
and
in
several
other
places,
is
peculiarly
happy
in
the
dignity
of
religious
allusions.
Manners
and
character
are
also
required
in
the
epic
poem.
But
all
the
epics
which
have
appeared
are,
except
two,
mere
copies
of
the
Iliad
in
these
respects.
Every
one
has
its
Agamemnon,
Achilles,
Ajax,
and
Ulysses;
its
calm,
furious,
gross,
and
intelligent
hero.
Camoëns
and
Milton
happily
left
this
beaten
track,
this
exhausted
field,
and
have
given
us
pictures
of
manners
unknown
in
the
Iliad,
the
Æneid,
and
all
those
poems
which
may
be
classed
with
the
Thebaid.
The
Lusiad
abounds
with
pictures
of
manners,
from
those
of
the
highest
chivalry
to
those
of
the
rudest,
fiercest,
and
most
innocent
barbarism.
In
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
ninth
books,
Leonardo
and
Veloso
are
painted
in
stronger
colours
than
any
of
the
inferior
characters
in
Virgil.
But
_character_,
indeed,
is
not
the
excellence
of
the
Æneid.
That
of
Monzaida,
the
friend
of
Gama,
is
much
superior
to
that
of
Achates.
The
base,
selfish,
perfidious
and
cruel
character
of
the
Zamorim
and
the
Moors,
are
painted
in
the
strongest
colours;
and
the
character
of
Gama
himself
is
that
of
the
finished
hero.
His
cool
command
of
his
passions,
his
deep
sagacity,
his
fixed
intrepidity,
his
tenderness
of
heart,
his
manly
piety,
and
his
high
enthusiasm
in
the
love
of
his
country
are
all
displayed
in
the
superlative
degree.
Let
him
who
objects
the
want
of
character
to
the
Lusiad,
beware
lest
he
stumble
upon
its
praise;
lest
he
only
say,
it
wants
an
Achilles,
a
Hector,
and
a
Priam.
And,
to
the
novelty
of
the
manners
of
the
Lusiad
let
the
novelty
of
fire-arms
also
be
added.
It
has
been
said
that
the
buckler,
the
bow,
and
the
spear,
must
continue
the
arms
of
poetry.
Yet,
however
unsuccessful
others
may
have
been,
Camoëns
has
proved
that
fire-arms
may
be
introduced
with
the
greatest
dignity,
and
the
finest
effect
in
the
epic
poem.
As
the
grand
interest
of
commerce
and
of
mankind
forms
the
subject
of
the
Lusiad,
so,
with
great
propriety,
as
necessary
accompaniments
to
the
voyage
of
his
hero,
the
author
has
given
poetical
pictures
of
the
four
parts
of
the
world--in
the
third
book
a
view
of
Europe;
in
the
fifth,
a
view
of
Africa;
and
in
the
tenth,
a
picture
of
Asia
and
America.
Homer
and
Virgil
have
been
highly
praised
for
their
judgment
in
the
choice
of
subjects
which
interested
their
countrymen,
and
Statius
has
been
as
severely
condemned
for
his
uninteresting
choice.
But,
though
the
subject
of
Camoëns
be
particularly
interesting
to
his
own
countrymen,
it
has
also
the
peculiar
happiness
to
be
the
poem
of
every
trading
nation.
It
is
the
epic
poem
of
the
birth
of
commerce,
and,
in
a
particular
manner,
the
epic
poem
of
whatever
country
has
the
control
and
possession
of
the
commerce
of
India.[18]
An
unexhausted
fertility
and
variety
of
poetical
description,
an
unexhausted
elevation
of
sentiment,
and
a
constant
tenor
of
the
grand
simplicity
of
diction,
complete
the
character
of
the
Lusiad
of
Camoëns:
a
poem
which,
though
it
has
hitherto
received
from
the
public
most
unmerited
neglect,
and
from
the
critics
most
flagrant
injustice,
was
yet
better
understood
by
the
greatest
poet
of
Italy.
Tasso
never
did
his
judgment
more
credit
than
when
he
confessed
that
he
dreaded
Camoëns
as
a
rival;
or
his
generosity
more
honour
than
when
he
addressed
the
elegant
sonnet
to
the
hero
of
the
Lusiad,
commencing--
"Vasco,
le
cui
felici,
ardite
antenne
In
contro
al
sol,
che
ne
riporta
il
giorno."
It
only
remains
to
give
some
account
of
the
version
of
the
Lusiad
which
is
now
offered
to
the
public.
Beside
the
translations
mentioned
in
the
life
of
Camoëns,
M.
Duperron
De
Castera,
in
1735,
gave,
in
French
prose,
a
loose
unpoetical
paraphrase[19]
of
the
Lusiad.
Nor
does
Sir
Richard
Fanshaw's
English
version,
published
during
the
usurpation
of
Cromwell,
merit
a
better
character.
Though
stanza
be
rendered
for
stanza,
though
at
first
view
it
has
the
appearance
of
being
exceedingly
literal,
this
version
is
nevertheless
exceedingly
unfaithful.
Uncountenanced
by
his
original,
Fanshaw--
"Teems
with
many
a
dead-born
just."[20]
Nor
had
he
the
least
idea
of
the
dignity
of
the
epic
style,[21]
or
of
the
true
spirit
of
poetical
translation.
For
this,
indeed,
no
definite
rule
can
be
given.
The
translator's
feelings
alone
must
direct
him,
for
the
spirit
of
poetry
is
sure
to
evaporate
in
literal
translation.
Indeed,
literal
translation
of
poetry
is
a
solecism.
You
may
construe
your
author,
indeed,
but,
if
with
some
translators
you
boast
that
you
have
left
your
author
to
speak
for
himself,
that
you
have
neither
added
nor
diminished,
you
have
in
reality
grossly
abused
him,
and
deceived
yourself.
Your
literal
translation
can
have
no
claim
to
the
original
felicities
of
expression;
the
energy,
elegance,
and
fire
of
the
original
poetry.
It
may
bear,
indeed,
a
resemblance;
but
such
a
one
as
a
corpse
in
the
sepulchre
bears
to
the
former
man
when
he
moved
in
the
bloom
and
vigour
of
life.
_Nec
verbum
verbo
curabis
reddere,
fidus
Interpres,_
was
the
taste
of
the
Augustan
age.
None
but
a
poet
can
translate
a
poet.
The
freedom
which
this
precept
gives,
will,
therefore,
in
a
poet's
hands,
not
only
infuse
the
energy,
elegance,
and
fire
of
his
author's
poetry
into
his
own
version,
but
will
give
it
also
the
spirit
of
an
original.
He
who
can
construe
may
perform
all
that
is
claimed
by
the
literal
translator.
He
who
attempts
the
manner
of
translation
prescribed
by
Horace,
ventures
upon
a
task
of
genius.
Yet,
however
daring
the
undertaking,
and
however
he
may
have
failed
in
it,
the
translator
acknowledges,
that
in
this
spirit
he
has
endeavoured
to
give
the
Lusiad
in
English.
Even
farther
liberties,
in
one
or
two
instances,
seemed
to
him
advantageous----
But
a
minuteness[22]
in
the
mention
of
these
will
not
appear
with
a
good
grace
in
this
edition
of
his
work;
and
besides,
the
original
is
in
the
hands
of
the
world.
MICKLE'S
INTRODUCTION
TO
THE
LUSIAD.
If
a
concatenation
of
events
centred
in
one
great
action--events
which
gave
birth
to
the
present
commercial
system
of
the
world--if
these
be
of
the
first
importance
in
the
civil
history
of
mankind,
then
the
Lusiad,
of
all
other
poems,
challenges
the
attention
of
the
philosopher,
the
politician,
and
the
gentleman.
In
contradistinction
to
the
Iliad
and
the
Æneid,
the
Paradise
Lost
has
been
called
the
Epic
Poem
of
Religion.
In
the
same
manner
may
the
Lusiad
be
named
the
Epic
Poem
of
Commerce.
The
happy
completion
of
the
most
important
designs
of
Henry,
Duke
of
Viseo,
prince
of
Portugal,
to
whom
Europe
owes
both
Gama
and
Columbus,
both
the
eastern
and
the
western
worlds,
constitutes
the
subject
of
this
celebrated
epic
poem.
But
before
we
proceed
to
the
historical
introduction
necessary
to
elucidate
a
poem
founded
on
such
an
important
period
of
history,
some
attention
is
due
to
the
opinion
of
those
theorists
in
political
philosophy
who
lament
that
India
was
ever
discovered,
and
who
assert
that
increase
of
trade
is
only
the
parent
of
degeneracy,
and
the
nurse
of
every
vice.
Much,
indeed,
may
be
urged
on
this
side
of
the
question;
but
much,
also,
may
be
urged
against
every
institution
relative
to
man.
Imperfection,
if
not
necessary
to
humanity,
is
at
least
the
certain
attendant
on
everything
human.
Though
some
part
of
the
traffic
with
many
countries
resemble
Solomon's
importation
of
apes
and
peacocks;
though
the
superfluities
of
life,
the
baubles
of
the
opulent,
and
even
the
luxuries
which
enervate
the
irresolute
and
administer
disease,
are
introduced
by
the
intercourse
of
navigation,
yet
the
extent
of
the
benefits
which
attend
it
are
also
to
be
considered
before
the
man
of
cool
reason
will
venture
to
pronounce
that
the
world
is
injured,
and
rendered
less
virtuous
and
happy
by
the
increase
of
commerce.
If
a
view
of
the
state
of
mankind,
where
commerce
opens
no
intercourse
between
nation
and
nation
be
neglected,
unjust
conclusions
will
certainly
follow.
Where
the
state
of
barbarians,
and
of
countries
under
different
degrees
of
civilization
are
candidly
weighed,
we
may
reasonably
expect
a
just
decision.
As
evidently
as
the
appointment
of
nature
gives
pasture
to
the
herds,
so
evidently
is
man
born
for
society.
As
every
other
animal
is
in
its
natural
state
when
in
the
situation
which
its
instinct
requires,
so
man,
when
his
reason
is
cultivated,
is
then,
and
only
then,
in
the
state
proper
to
his
nature.
The
life
of
the
naked
savage,
who
feeds
on
acorns
and
sleeps
like
a
beast
in
his
den,
is
commonly
called
the
natural
state
of
man;
but,
if
there
be
any
propriety
in
this
assertion,
his
rational
faculties
compose
no
part
of
his
nature,
and
were
given
not
to
be
used.
If
the
savage,
therefore,
live
in
a
state
contrary
to
the
appointment
of
nature,
it
must
follow
that
he
is
not
so
happy
as
nature
intended
him
to
be.
And
a
view
of
his
true
character
will
confirm
this
conclusion.
The
reveries,
the
fairy
dreams
of
a
Rousseau,
may
figure
the
paradisaical
life
of
a
Hottentot,
but
it
is
only
in
such
dreams
that
the
superior
happiness
of
the
barbarian
exists.
The
savage,
it
is
true,
is
reluctant
to
leave
his
manner
of
life;
but,
unless
we
allow
that
he
is
a
proper
judge
of
the
modes
of
living,
his
attachment
to
his
own
by
no
means
proves
that
he
is
happier
than
he
might
otherwise
have
been.
His
attachment
only
exemplifies
the
amazing
power
of
habit
in
reconciling
the
human
breast
to
the
most
uncomfortable
situations.
If
the
intercourse
of
mankind
in
some
instances
be
introductive
of
vice,
the
want
of
it
as
certainly
excludes
the
exertion
of
the
noblest
virtues;
and,
if
the
seeds
of
virtue
are
indeed
in
the
heart,
they
often
lie
dormant,
and
even
unknown
to
the
savage
possessor.
The
most
beautiful
description
of
a
tribe
of
savages
(which
we
may
be
assured
is
from
real
life)
occurs
in
these
words:[23]
And
the
five
spies
of
Dan
"came
to
Laish,
and
saw
the
people
that
were
there,
how
they
dwelt
careless,
after
the
manner
of
the
Zidonians,
quiet
and
secure;
and
there
was
no
magistrate
in
the
land,
that
might
put
them
to
shame
in
anything...."
And
the
spies
said
to
their
brethren,
"Arise,
that
we
may
go
up
against
them;
for
we
have
seen
the
land,
and,
behold,
it
is
very
good....
And
they
came
unto
Laish,
unto
a
people
that
were
at
quiet
and
secure:
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
burnt
the
city
with
fire.
And
there
was
no
deliverer,
because
it
was
far
from
Zidon,
and
they
had
no
business
with
any
man."
However
the
happy
simplicity
of
this
society
may
please
the
man
of
fine
imagination,
the
true
philosopher
will
view
the
men
of
Laish
with
other
eyes.
However
virtuous
he
may
suppose
one
generation,
it
requires
an
alteration
of
human
nature
to
preserve
the
children
of
the
next
in
the
same
generous
estrangement
from
the
selfish
passions--from
those
passions
which
are
the
parents
of
the
acts
of
injustice.
When
his
wants
are
easily
supplied,
the
manners
of
the
savage
will
be
simple,
and
often
humane,
for
the
human
heart
is
not
vicious
without
objects
of
temptation.
But
these
will
soon
occur;
he
that
gathers
the
greatest
quantity
of
fruit
will
be
envied
by
the
less
industrious.
The
uninformed
mind
seems
insensible
of
the
idea
of
the
right
of
possession
which
the
labour
of
acquirement
gives.
When
want
is
pressing,
and
the
supply
at
hand,
the
only
consideration
with
such
minds
is
the
danger
of
seizing
it;
and
where
there
is
no
magistrate
to
put
to
shame
in
anything,
depredation
will
soon
display
all
its
horrors.
Let
it
even
be
admitted
that
the
innocence
of
the
men
of
Laish
could
secure
them
from
the
consequences
of
their
own
unrestrained
desires,
could
even
this
impossibility
be
surmounted,
still
are
they
a
wretched
prey
to
the
first
invaders,
and
because
they
have
no
business
with
any
man,
they
will
find
no
deliverer.
While
human
nature
is
the
same,
the
fate
of
Laish
will
always
be
the
fate
of
the
weak
and
defenceless;
and
thus
the
most
amiable
description
of
savage
life
raises
in
our
minds
the
strongest
imagery
of
the
misery
and
impossible
continuance
of
such
a
state.
But
if
the
view
of
these
innocent
people
terminate
in
horror,
with
what
contemplation
shall
we
behold
the
wilds
of
Africa
and
America?
The
tribes
of
America,
it
is
true,
have
degrees
of
policy
greatly
superior
to
anything
understood
by
the
men
of
Laish.
Great
masters
of
martial
oratory,
their
popular
assemblies
are
schools
open
to
all
their
youth.
In
these
they
not
only
learn
the
history
of
their
nation,
and
what
they
have
to
fear
from
the
strength
and
designs
of
their
enemies,
but
they
also
imbibe
the
most
ardent
spirit
of
war.
The
arts
of
stratagem
are
their
study,
and
the
most
athletic
exercises
of
the
field
their
employment
and
delight;
and,
what
is
their
greatest
praise,
they
have
magistrates
"to
put
them
to
shame."
They
inflict
no
corporeal
punishment
on
their
countrymen,
it
is
true;
but
a
reprimand
from
an
elder,
delivered
in
the
assembly,
is
esteemed
by
them
a
deeper
degradation
and
severer
punishment
than
any
of
those
too
often
most
impolitically
adopted
by
civilized
nations.
Yet,
though
possessed
of
this
advantage--an
advantage
impossible
to
exist
in
a
large
commercial
empire--and
though
masters
of
great
martial
policy,
their
condition,
upon
the
whole,
is
big
with
the
most
striking
demonstration
of
the
misery
and
unnatural
state
of
such
very
imperfect
civilization.
"Multiply
and
replenish
the
earth"
is
an
injunction
of
the
best
political
philosophy
ever
given
to
man.
Nature
has
appointed
man
to
cultivate
the
earth,
to
increase
in
number
by
the
food
which
its
culture
gives,
and
by
this
increase
of
brethren
to
remove
some,
and
to
mitigate
all,
the
natural
miseries
of
human
life.
But
in
direct
opposition
to
this
is
the
political
state
of
the
wild
aborigines
of
America.
Their
lands,
luxuriant
in
climate,
are
often
desolate
wastes,
where
thousands
of
miles
hardly
support
a
few
hundreds
of
savage
hunters.
Attachment
to
their
own
tribe
constitutes
their
highest
idea
of
virtue;
but
this
virtue
includes
the
most
brutal
depravity,
makes
them
esteem
the
man
of
every
other
tribe
as
an
enemy,
as
one
with
whom
nature
had
placed
them
in
a
state
of
war,
and
had
commanded
to
destroy.[24]
And
to
this
principle
their
customs
and
ideas
of
honour
serve
as
rituals
and
ministers.
The
cruelties
practised
by
the
American
savages
on
their
prisoners
of
war
(and
war
is
their
chief
employment)
convey
every
idea
expressed
by
the
word
diabolical,
and
give
a
most
shocking
view
of
the
degradation
of
human
nature.
But
what
peculiarly
completes
the
character
of
the
savage
is
his
horrible
superstition.
In
the
most
distant
nations
the
savage
is,
in
this
respect,
the
same.
The
terror
of
evil
spirits
continually
haunts
him;
his
God
is
beheld
as
a
relentless
tyrant,
and
is
worshipped
often
with
cruel
rites,
always
with
a
heart
full
of
horror
and
fear.
In
all
the
numerous
accounts
of
savage
worship,
one
trace
of
filial
dependence
is
not
to
be
found.
The
very
reverse
of
that
happy
idea
is
the
hell
of
the
ignorant
mind.
Nor
is
this
barbarism
confined
alone
to
those
ignorant
tribes
whom
we
call
savages.
The
vulgar
of
every
country
possess
it
in
certain
degrees,
proportionated
to
their
opportunities
of
conversation
with
the
more
enlightened.
Sordid
disposition
and
base
ferocity,
together
with
the
most
unhappy
superstition,
are
everywhere
the
proportionate
attendants
of
ignorance
and
severe
want.
And
ignorance
and
want
are
only
removed
by
intercourse
and
the
offices
of
society.
So
self-evident
are
these
positions,
that
it
requires
an
apology
for
insisting
upon
them;
but
the
apology
is
at
hand.
He
who
has
read
knows
how
many
eminent
writers,[25]
and
he
who
has
conversed
knows
how
many
respectable
names,
connect
the
idea
of
innocence
and
happiness
with
the
life
of
the
savage
and
the
unimproved
rustic.
To
fix
the
character
of
the
savage
is
therefore
necessary,
ere
we
examine
the
assertion,
that
"it
had
been
happy
for
both
the
old
and
the
new
worlds
if
the
East
and
West
Indies
had
never
been
discovered."
The
bloodshed
and
the
attendant
miseries
which
the
unparalleled
rapine
and
cruelties
of
the
Spaniards
spread
over
the
new
world,
indeed
disgrace
human
nature.
The
great
and
flourishing
empires
of
Mexico
and
Peru,
steeped
in
the
blood
of
forty
millions
of
their
sons,
present
a
melancholy
prospect,
which
must
excite
the
indignation
of
every
good
heart.
Yet
such
desolation
is
not
the
certain
consequence
of
discovery.
And,
even
should
we
allow
that
the
depravity
of
human
nature
is
so
great
that
the
avarice
of
the
merchant
and
rapacity
of
the
soldier
will
overwhelm
with
misery
every
new-discovered
country,
still,
are
there
other,
more
comprehensive
views,
to
be
taken,
ere
we
decide
against
the
intercourse
introduced
by
navigation.
When
we
weigh
the
happiness
of
Europe
in
the
scale
of
political
philosophy,
we
are
not
to
confine
our
eye
to
the
dreadful
ravages
of
Attila
the
Hun,
or
of
Alaric
the
Goth.
If
the
waters
of
a
stagnated
lake
are
disturbed
by
the
spade
when
led
into
new
channels,
we
ought
not
to
inveigh
against
the
alteration
because
the
waters
are
fouled
at
the
first;
we
are
to
wait
to
see
the
streamlets
refine
and
spread
beauty
and
utility
through
a
thousand
vales
which
they
never
visited
before.
Such
were
the
conquests
of
Alexander,
temporary
evils,
but
civilization
and
happiness
followed
in
the
bloody
track.
And,
though
disgraced
with
every
barbarity,
happiness
has
also
followed
the
conquests
of
the
Spaniards
in
the
other
hemisphere.
Though
the
villainy
of
the
Jesuits
defeated
their
schemes
of
civilization
in
many
countries,
the
labours
of
that
society
have
been
crowned
with
a
success
in
Paraguay
and
in
Canada,
which
reflects
upon
their
industry
the
greatest
honour.
The
customs
and
cruelties
of
many
American
tribes
still
disgrace
human
nature,
but
in
Paraguay
and
Canada
the
natives
have
been
brought
to
relish
the
blessings
of
society,
and
the
arts
of
virtuous
and
civil
life.
If
Mexico
is
not
so
populous
as
it
once
was,
neither
is
it
so
barbarous;[26]
the
shrieks
of
the
human
victim
do
not
now
resound
from
temple
to
temple,
nor
does
the
human
heart,
held
up
reeking
to
the
sun,
imprecate
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
on
the
guilty
empire.
And,
however
impolitically
despotic
the
Spanish
governments
may
be,
still
do
these
colonies
enjoy
the
opportunities
of
improvement,
which
in
every
age
arise
from
the
knowledge
of
commerce
and
of
letters--opportunities
which
were
never
enjoyed
in
South
America
under
the
reigns
of
Montezuma
and
Atabalipa.
But
if
from
Spanish,
we
turn
our
eyes
to
British
America,
what
a
glorious
prospect!
Here,
formerly,
on
the
wild
lawn,
perhaps
twice
in
the
year,
a
few
savage
hunters
kindled
their
evening
fire,
kindled
it
more
to
protect
them
from
evil
spirits
and
beasts
of
prey,
than
from
the
cold,
and
with
their
feet
pointed
to
it,
slept
on
the
ground.
Here,
now,
population
spreads
her
thousands,
and
society
appears
in
all
its
blessings
of
mutual
help,
and
the
mutual
lights
of
intellectual
improvement.
"What
work
of
art,
or
power,
or
public
utility,
has
ever
equalled
the
glory
of
having
peopled
a
continent,
without
guilt
or
bloodshed,
with
a
multitude
of
free
and
happy
commonwealths;
to
have
given
them
the
best
arts
of
life
and
government!"
To
have
given
a
savage
continent
an
image
of
the
British
Constitution
is,
indeed,
the
greatest
glory
of
the
British
crown,
"a
greater
than
any
other
nation
ever
acquired;"
and
from
the
consequences
of
the
genius
of
Henry,
Duke
of
Viseo,
did
the
British
American
empire
arise,
an
empire
which,
unless
retarded
by
the
illiberal
and
inhuman
spirit
of
religious
fanaticism,
will
in
a
few
centuries,
perhaps,
be
the
glory
of
the
world.
Stubborn
indeed
must
be
the
theorist
who
will
deny
the
improvement,
virtue,
and
happiness
which,
in
the
result,
the
voyage
of
Columbus
has
spread
over
the
western
world.
The
happiness
which
Europe
and
Asia
have
received
from
the
intercourse
with
each
other,
cannot
hitherto,
it
must
be
owned,
be
compared
either
with
the
possession
of
it,
or
the
source
of
its
increase
established
in
America.
Yet,
let
the
man
of
the
most
melancholy
views
estimate
all
the
wars
and
depredations
which
are
charged
upon
the
Portuguese
and
other
European
nations,
still
will
the
eastern
world
appear
considerably
advantaged
by
the
voyage
of
Gama.
If
seas
of
blood
have
been
shed
by
the
Portuguese,
nothing
new
was
introduced
into
India.
War
and
depredation
were
no
unheard-of
strangers
on
the
banks
of
the
Ganges,
nor
could
the
nature
of
the
civil
establishments
of
the
eastern
nations
secure
a
lasting
peace.
The
ambition
of
their
native
princes
was
only
diverted
into
new
channels,
into
channels
which,
in
the
natural
course
of
human
affairs,
will
certainly
lead
to
permanent
governments,
established
on
improved
laws
and
just
dominion.
Yet,
even
ere
such
governments
are
formed,
is
Asia
no
loser
by
the
arrival
of
Europeans.
The
horrid
massacres
and
unbounded
rapine
which,
according
to
their
own
annals,
followed
the
victories
of
their
Asian
conquerors
were
never
equalled
by
the
worst
of
their
European
vanquishers.
Nor
is
the
establishment
of
improved
governments
in
the
East
the
dream
of
theory.
The
superiority
of
the
civil
and
military
arts
of
the
British,
notwithstanding
the
hateful
character
of
some
individuals,
is
at
this
day
beheld
in
India
with
all
the
astonishment
of
admiration;
and
admiration
is
always
followed,
though
often
with
retarded
steps,
by
the
strong
desire
of
similar
improvement.
Long
after
the
fall
of
the
Roman
empire
the
Roman
laws
were
adopted
by
nations
which
ancient
Rome
esteemed
as
barbarous.
And
thus,
in
the
course
of
ages,
the
British
laws,
according
to
every
test
of
probability,
will
have
a
most
important
effect,
will
fulfil
the
prophecy
of
Camoëns,
and
transfer
to
the
British
the
high
compliment
he
pays
to
his
countrymen--
"Beneath
their
sway
majestic,
wise,
and
mild,
Proud
of
her
victor's
laws
thrice
happier
India
smiled."
In
former
ages,
and
within
these
few
years,
the
fertile
empire
of
India
has
exhibited
every
scene
of
human
misery,
under
the
undistinguishing
ravages
of
their
Mohammedan
and
native
princes;
ravages
only
equalled
in
European
history
by
those
committed
under
Atilla,
surnamed
"the
scourge
of
God,"
and
"the
destroyer
of
nations."
The
ideas
of
patriotism
and
of
honour
were
seldom
known
in
the
cabinets
of
the
eastern
princes
till
the
arrival
of
the
Europeans.
Every
species
of
assassination
was
the
policy
of
their
courts,
and
every
act
of
unrestrained
rapine
and
massacre
followed
the
path
of
victory.
But
some
of
the
Portuguese
governors,
and
many
of
the
English
officers,
have
taught
them
that
humanity
to
the
conquered
is
the
best,
the
truest
policy.
The
brutal
ferocity
of
their
own
conquerors
is
now
the
object
of
their
greatest
dread;
and
the
superiority
of
the
British
in
war
has
convinced
their
princes,[27]
that
an
alliance
with
the
British
is
the
surest
guarantee
of
their
national
peace
and
prosperity.
While
the
English
East
India
Company
are
possessed
of
their
present
greatness,
it
is
in
their
power
to
diffuse
over
the
East
every
blessing
which
flows
from
the
wisest
and
most
humane
policy.
Long
ere
the
Europeans
arrived,
a
failure
of
the
crop
of
rice,
the
principal
food
of
India,
had
spread
the
devastations
of
famine
over
the
populous
plains
of
Bengal.
And
never,
from
the
seven
years'
famine
of
ancient
Egypt
to
the
present
day,
was
there
a
natural
scarcity
in
any
country
which
did
not
enrich
the
proprietors
of
the
granaries.
The
Mohammedan
princes,
and
Moorish
traders
have
often
added
all
the
horrors
of
an
artificial,
to
a
natural,
famine.
But,
however
some
Portuguese
or
other
governors
may
stand
accused,
much
was
left
for
the
humanity
of
the
more
exalted
policy
of
an
Albuquerque,
or
a
Castro.
And
under
such
European
governors
as
these,
the
distresses
of
the
East
have
often
been
alleviated
by
a
generosity
of
conduct,
and
a
train
of
resources
formerly
unknown
in
Asia.
Absurd
and
impracticable
were
that
scheme
which
would
introduce
the
British
laws
into
India
without
the
deepest
regard
to
the
manners
and
circumstances
peculiar
to
the
people.
But
that
spirit
of
liberty
upon
which
they
are
founded,
and
that
security
of
property
which
is
their
leading
principle,
must
in
time
have
a
wide
and
stupendous
effect.
The
abject
spirit
of
Asiatic
submission
will
be
taught
to
see,
and
to
claim,
those
rights
of
nature,
of
which
the
dispirited
and
passive
Hindus
could,
till
lately,
hardly
form
an
idea.
From
this,
as
naturally
as
the
noon
succeeds
the
dawn,
must
the
other
blessings
of
civilization
arise.
For,
though
the
four
great
castes
of
India
are
almost
inaccessible
to
the
introduction
of
other
manners,
and
of
other
literature
than
their
own,
happily
there
is
in
human
nature
a
propensity
to
change.
Nor
may
the
political
philosopher
be
deemed
an
enthusiast
who
would
boldly
prophesy,
that
unless
the
British
be
driven
from
India
the
general
superiority
which
they
bear
will,
ere
many
generations
shall
have
passed,
induce
the
most
intelligent
of
India
to
break
the
shackles
of
their
absurd
superstitions,[28]
and
lead
them
to
partake
of
those
advantages
which
arise
from
the
free
scope
and
due
cultivation
of
the
rational
powers.
In
almost
every
instance
the
Indian
institutions
are
contrary
to
the
feelings
and
wishes
of
nature.
And
ignorance
and
bigotry,
their
two
chief
pillars,
can
never
secure
unalterable
duration.
We
have
certain
proof
that
the
horrid
custom
of
burning
the
wives
along
with
the
body
of
the
deceased
husband
has
continued
for
upwards
of
fifteen
hundred
years;
we
are
also
certain
that
within
these
twenty
years
it
has
begun
to
fall
into
disuse.
Together
with
the
alteration
of
this
most
striking
feature
of
Indian
manners,
other
assimilations
to
European
sentiments
have
already
taken
place.
Nor
can
the
obstinacy
even
of
the
conceited
Chinese
always
resist
the
desire
of
imitating
the
Europeans,
a
people
who
in
arts
and
arms
are
so
greatly
superior
to
themselves.
The
use
of
the
twenty-four
letters,
by
which
we
can
express
every
language,
appeared
at
first
as
miraculous
to
the
Chinese.
Prejudice
cannot
always
deprive
that
people,
who
are
not
deficient
in
selfish
cunning,
of
the
ease
and
expedition
of
an
alphabet;
and
it
is
easy
to
foresee
that,
in
the
course
of
a
few
centuries,
some
alphabet
will
certainly
take
the
place
of
the
60,000
arbitrary
marks
which
now
render
the
cultivation
of
the
Chinese
literature
not
only
a
labour
of
the
utmost
difficulty,
but
even
the
attainment
impossible
beyond
a
very
limited
degree.
And
from
the
introduction
of
an
alphabet,
what
improvements
may
not
be
expected
from
the
laborious
industry
of
the
Chinese!
Though
most
obstinately
attached
to
their
old
customs,
yet
there
is
a
tide
in
the
manners
of
nations
which
is
sudden
and
rapid,
and
which
acts
with
a
kind
of
instinctive
fury
against
ancient
prejudice
and
absurdity.
It
was
that
nation
of
merchants,
the
Phœnicians,
which
diffused
the
use
of
letters
through
the
ancient,
and
commerce
will
undoubtedly
diffuse
the
same
blessings
through
the
modern,
world.
To
this
view
of
the
political
happiness
which
is
sure
to
be
introduced
in
proportion
to
civilization,
let
the
divine
add
what
may
be
reasonably
expected
from
such
opportunity
of
the
increase
of
religion.
A
factory
of
merchants,
indeed,
has
seldom
been
found
to
be
a
school
of
piety;
yet,
when
the
general
manners
of
a
people
become
assimilated
to
those
of
a
more
rational
worship,
something
more
than
ever
was
produced
by
an
infant
mission,
or
the
neighbourhood
of
an
infant
colony,
may
then
be
reasonably
expected,
and
even
foretold.
In
estimating
the
political
happiness
of
a
people,
nothing
is
of
greater
importance
than
their
capacity
of,
and
tendency
to,
improvement.
As
a
dead
lake,
to
continue
our
former
illustration,
will
remain
in
the
same
state
for
ages
and
ages,
so
would
the
bigotry
and
superstitions
of
the
East
continue
the
same.
But
if
the
lake
is
begun
to
be
opened
into
a
thousand
rivulets,
who
knows
over
what
unnumbered
fields,
barren
before,
they
may
diffuse
the
blessings
of
fertility,
and
turn
a
dreary
wilderness
into
a
land
of
society
and
joy.
In
contrast
to
this,
let
the
Gold
Coast
and
other
immense
regions
of
Africa
be
contemplated--
"Afric
behold;
alas,
what
altered
view!
Her
lands
uncultured,
and
her
sons
untrue;
Ungraced
with
all
that
sweetens
human
life,
Savage
and
fierce
they
roam
in
brutal
strife;
Eager
they
grasp
the
gifts
which
culture
yields,
Yet
naked
roam
their
own
neglected
fields....
Unnumber'd
tribes
as
bestial
grazers
stray,
By
laws
unform'd,
unform'd
by
Reason's
sway.
Far
inward
stretch
the
mournful
sterile
dales,
Where
on
the
parch'd
hill-side
pale
famine
wails."
LUSIAD
X.
Let
us
consider
how
many
millions
of
these
unhappy
savages
are
dragged
from
their
native
fields,
and
cut
off
for
ever
from
all
the
hopes
and
all
the
rights
to
which
human
birth
entitled
them.
And
who
would
hesitate
to
pronounce
that
negro
the
greatest
of
patriots,
who,
by
teaching
his
countrymen
the
arts
of
society,
should
teach
them
to
defend
themselves
in
the
possession
of
their
fields,
their
families,
and
their
own
personal
liberties?
Evident,
however,
as
it
is,
that
the
voyages
of
Gama
and
Columbus
have
already
carried
a
superior
degree
of
happiness,
and
the
promise
of
infinitely
more,
to
the
eastern
and
western
worlds;
yet
the
advantages
to
Europe
from
the
discovery
of
these
regions
may
perhaps
be
denied.
But
let
us
view
what
Europe
was,
ere
the
genius
of
Don
Henry
gave
birth
to
the
spirit
of
modern
discovery.
Several
ages
before
this
period
the
feudal
system
had
degenerated
into
the
most
absolute
tyranny.
The
barons
exercised
the
most
despotic
authority
over
their
vassals,
and
every
scheme
of
public
utility
was
rendered
impracticable
by
their
continual
petty
wars
with
each
other;
to
which
they
led
their
dependents
as
dogs
to
the
chase.
Unable
to
read,
or
to
write
his
own
name,
the
chieftain
was
entirely
possessed
by
the
most
romantic
opinion
of
military
glory,
and
the
song
of
his
domestic
minstrel
constituted
his
highest
idea
of
fame.
The
classic
authors
slept
on
the
shelves
of
the
monasteries,
their
dark
but
happy
asylum,
while
the
life
of
the
monks
resembled
that
of
the
fattened
beeves
which
loaded
their
tables.
Real
abilities
were
indeed
possessed
by
a
Duns
Scotus
and
a
few
others;
but
these
were
lost
in
the
most
trifling
subtleties
of
a
sophistry
which
they
dignified
with
the
name
of
casuistical
divinity.
Whether
Adam
and
Eve
were
created
with
navels?
and
How
many
thousand
angels
might
at
the
same
instant
dance
upon
the
point
of
the
finest
needle
without
one
jostling
another?
were
two
of
the
several
topics
of
like
importance
which
excited
the
acumen
and
engaged
the
controversies
of
the
learned.
While
every
branch
of
philosophical,
of
rational
investigation,
was
thus
unpursued
and
unknown,
commerce,
which
is
incompatible
with
the
feudal
system,
was
equally
neglected
and
unimproved.
Where
the
mind
is
enlarged
and
enlightened
by
learning,
plans
of
commerce
will
rise
into
action,
and
these,
in
return,
will
from
every
part
of
the
world
bring
new
acquirements
to
philosophy
and
science.
The
birth
of
learning
and
commerce
may
be
different,
but
their
growth
is
mutual
and
dependent
upon
each
other.
They
not
only
assist
each
other,
but
the
same
enlargement
of
mind
which
is
necessary
for
perfection
in
the
one
is
also
necessary
for
perfection
in
the
other;
and
the
same
causes
impede,
and
are
alike
destructive
of,
both.
The
INTERCOURSE
of
mankind
is
the
parent
of
each.
According
to
the
confinement
or
extent
of
intercourse,
barbarity
or
civilization
proportionately
prevail.
In
the
dark,
monkish
ages,
the
intercourse
of
the
learned
was
as
much
impeded
and
confined
as
that
of
the
merchant.
A
few
unwieldy
vessels
coasted
the
shores
of
Europe,
and
mendicant
friars
and
ignorant
pilgrims
carried
a
miserable
account
of
what
was
passing
in
the
world
from
monastery
to
monastery.
What
doctor
had
last
disputed
on
the
peripatetic
philosophy
at
some
university,
or
what
new
heresy
had
last
appeared,
not
only
comprised
the
whole
of
their
literary
intelligence,
but
was
delivered
with
little
accuracy,
and
received
with
as
little
attention.
While
this
thick
cloud
of
mental
darkness
overspread
the
western
world,
was
Don
Henry,
prince
of
Portugal,
born;
born
to
set
mankind
free
from
the
feudal
system,
and
to
give
to
the
whole
world
every
advantage,
every
light
that
may
possibly
be
diffused
by
the
intercourse
of
unlimited
commerce:--
"For
then
from
ancient
gloom
emerg'd
The
rising
world
of
trade:
the
genius,
then,
Of
navigation,
that
in
hopeless
sloth
Had
slumber'd
on
the
vast
Atlantic
deep
For
idle
ages,
starting
heard
at
last
The
Lusitanian
prince,
who,
Heaven-inspir'd,
To
love
of
useful
glory
rous'd
mankind,
And
in
unbounded
commerce
mix'd
the
world."
THOMSON.
In
contrast
to
this
melancholy
view
of
human
nature,
sunk
in
barbarism
and
benighted
with
ignorance,
let
the
present
state
of
Europe
be
impartially
estimated.
Yet,
though
the
great
increase
of
opulence
and
learning
cannot
be
denied,
there
are
some
who
assert
that
virtue
and
happiness
have
as
greatly
declined.
And
the
immense
overflow
of
riches,
from
the
East
in
particular,
has
been
pronounced
big
with
destruction
to
the
British
empire.
Everything
human,
it
is
true,
has
its
dark
as
well
as
its
bright
side;
but
let
these
popular
complaints
be
examined,
and
it
will
be
found
that
modern
Europe,
and
the
British
empire
in
a
very
particular
manner,
have
received
the
greatest
and
most
solid
advantages
from
the
modern,
enlarged
system
of
commerce.
The
magic
of
the
old
romances,
which
could
make
the
most
withered,
deformed
hag,
appear
as
the
most
beautiful
virgin,
is
every
day
verified
in
popular
declamation.
Ancient
days
are
there
painted
in
the
most
amiable
simplicity,
and
the
modern
in
the
most
odious
colours.
Yet,
what
man
of
fortune
in
England
lives
in
that
stupendous
gross
luxury
which
every
day
was
exhibited
in
the
Gothic
castles
of
the
old
chieftains!
Four
or
five
hundred
knights
and
squires
in
the
domestic
retinue
of
a
warlike
earl
was
not
uncommon,
nor
was
the
pomp
of
embroidery
inferior
to
the
profuse
waste
of
their
tables;
in
both
instances
unequalled
by
all
the
mad
excesses
of
the
present
age.
While
the
baron
thus
lived
in
all
the
wild
glare
of
Gothic
luxury,
agriculture
was
almost
totally
neglected,
and
his
meaner
vassals
fared
harder,
infinitely
less
comfortably,
than
the
meanest
industrious
labourers
of
England
do
now;
where
the
lands
are
uncultivated,
the
peasants,
ill-clothed,
ill-lodged,
and
poorly
fed,
pass
their
miserable
days
in
sloth
and
filth,
totally
ignorant
of
every
advantage,
of
every
comfort
which
nature
lays
at
their
feet.
He
who
passes
from
the
trading
towns
and
cultured
fields
of
England
to
those
remote
villages
of
Scotland
or
Ireland
which
claim
this
description,
is
astonished
at
the
comparative
wretchedness
of
their
destitute
inhabitants;
but
few
consider
that
these
villages
only
exhibit
a
view
of
what
Europe
was
ere
the
spirit
of
commerce
diffused
the
blessings
which
naturally
flow
from
her
improvements.
In
the
Hebrides
the
failure
of
a
harvest
almost
depopulates
an
island.
Having
little
or
no
traffic
to
purchase
grain,
numbers
of
the
young
and
hale
betake
themselves
to
the
continent
in
quest
of
employment
and
food,
leaving
a
few,
less
adventurous,
behind,
to
beget
a
new
race,
the
heir
of
the
same
fortune.
Yet
from
the
same
cause,
from
the
want
of
traffic,
the
kingdom
of
England
has
often
felt
more
dreadful
effects
than
these.
Even
in
the
days
when
her
Henries
and
Edwards
plumed
themselves
with
the
trophies
of
France,
how
often
has
famine
spread
all
her
horrors
over
city
and
village?
Our
modern
histories
neglect
this
characteristic
feature
of
ancient
days;
but
the
rude
chronicles
of
these
ages
inform
us,
that
three
or
four
times
in
almost
every
reign
was
England
thus
visited.
The
failure
of
the
crop
was
then
severely
felt,
and
two
bad
harvests
in
succession
were
almost
insupportable.
But
commerce
has
now
opened
another
scene,
has
armed
government
with
the
happiest
power
that
can
be
exerted
by
the
rulers
of
a
nation--the
power
to
prevent
every
extremity[29]
which
may
possibly
arise
from
bad
harvests;
extremities,
which,
in
former
ages,
were
esteemed
more
dreadful
visitations
of
the
wrath
of
Heaven
than
the
pestilence
itself.
Yet
modern
London
is
not
so
certainly
defended
against
the
latter,
its
ancient
visitor,
than
the
commonwealth
by
the
means
of
commerce,
under
a
just
and
humane
government,
is
secured
against
the
ravages
of
the
former.
If,
from
these
great
outlines
of
the
happiness
enjoyed
by
a
commercial
over
an
uncommercial
nation,
we
turn
our
eyes
to
the
manners,
the
advantages
will
be
found
no
less
in
favour
of
the
civilized.
Whoever
is
inclined
to
declaim
at
the
vices
of
the
present
age,
let
him
read,
and
be
convinced,
that
the
Gothic
ages
were
less
virtuous.
If
the
spirit
of
chivalry
prevented
effeminacy,
it
was
the
foster-father
of
a
ferocity
of
manners
now
happily
unknown.
Rapacity,
avarice,
and
effeminacy
are
the
vices
ascribed
to
the
increase
of
commerce;
and
in
some
degree,
it
must
be
confessed,
they
follow
her
steps.
Yet
infinitely
more
dreadful,
as
every
palatinate
in
Europe
often
felt,
were
the
effects
of
the
two
first
under
the
feudal
lords
than
can
possibly
be
experienced
under
any
system
of
trade.
The
virtues
and
vices
of
human
nature
are
the
same
in
every
age:
they
only
receive
different
modifications,
and
are
dormant,
or
awakened
into
action,
under
different
circumstances.
The
feudal
lord
had
it
infinitely
more
in
his
power
to
be
rapacious
than
the
merchant.
And
whatever
avarice
may
attend
the
trader,
his
intercourse
with
the
rest
of
mankind
lifts
him
greatly
above
that
brutish
ferocity
which
actuates
the
savage,
often
the
rustic,
and
in
general
characterizes
the
ignorant
part
of
mankind.
The
abolition
of
the
feudal
system,
a
system
of
absolute
slavery,
and
that
equality
of
mankind
which
affords
the
protection
of
property,
and
every
other
incitement
to
industry,
are
the
glorious
gifts
which
the
spirit
of
commerce,
awakened
by
Prince
Henry
of
Portugal,
has
bestowed
upon
Europe
in
general;
and,
as
if
directed
by
the
manes
of
his
mother,
a
daughter
of
England,
upon
the
British
empire
in
particular.
In
the
vice
of
effeminacy
alone,
perhaps,
do
we
exceed
our
ancestors;
yet,
even
here
we
have
infinitely
the
advantage
over
them.
The
brutal
ferocity
of
former
ages
is
now
lost,
and
the
general
mind
is
humanized.
The
savage
breast
is
the
native
soil
of
revenge;
a
vice,
of
all
others,
peculiarly
stamped
with
the
character
of
hell.
But
the
mention
of
this
was
reserved
for
the
character
of
the
savages
of
Europe.
The
savage
of
every
country
is
implacable
when
injured;
but
among
some,
revenge
has
its
measure.
When
an
American
Indian
is
murdered
his
kindred
pursue
the
murderer;
and,
as
soon
as
blood
has
atoned
for
blood,
the
wilds
of
America
hear
the
hostile
parties
join
in
their
mutual
lamentations
over
the
dead,
whom,
as
an
oblivion
of
malice,
they
bury
together.
But
the
measure
of
revenge,
never
to
be
full,
was
left
for
the
demi-savages
of
Europe.
The
vassals
of
the
feudal
lord
entered
into
his
quarrels
with
the
most
inexorable
rage.
Just
or
unjust
was
no
consideration
of
theirs.
It
was
a
family
feud;
no
farther
inquiry
was
made;
and
from
age
to
age,
the
parties,
who
never
injured
each
other,
breathed
nothing
but
mutual
rancour
and
revenge.
And
actions,
suitable
to
this
horrid
spirit,
everywhere
confessed
its
virulent
influence.
Such
were
the
late
days
of
Europe,
admired
by
the
ignorant
for
the
innocence
of
manners.
Resentment
of
injury,
indeed,
is
natural;
and
there
is
a
degree
which
is
honest,
and
though
warm,
far
from
inhuman.
But
if
it
is
the
hard
task
of
humanized
virtue
to
preserve
the
feeling
of
an
injury
unmixed
with
the
slightest
criminal
wish
of
revenge,
how
impossible
is
it
for
the
savage
to
attain
the
dignity
of
forgiveness,
the
greatest
ornament
of
human
nature.
As
in
individuals,
a
virtue
will
rise
into
a
vice,
generosity
into
blind
profusion,
and
even
mercy
into
criminal
lenity,
so
civilized
manners
will
lead
the
opulent
into
effeminacy.
But
let
it
be
considered,
this
consequence
is
by
no
means
the
certain
result
of
civilization.
Civilization,
on
the
contrary,
provides
the
most
effectual
preventive
of
this
evil.
Where
classical
literature
prevails
the
manly
spirit
which
it
breathes
must
be
diffused;
whenever
frivolousness
predominates,
when
refinement
degenerates
into
whatever
enervates
the
mind,
literary
ignorance
is
sure
to
complete
the
effeminate
character.
A
mediocrity
of
virtues
and
of
talents
is
the
lot
of
the
great
majority
of
mankind;
and
even
this
mediocrity,
if
cultivated
by
a
liberal
education,
will
infallibly
secure
its
possessor
against
those
excesses
of
effeminacy
which
are
really
culpable.
To
be
of
plain
manners
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
a
clown,
or
to
wear
coarse
clothes;
nor
is
it
necessary
to
lie
on
the
ground
and
feed
like
the
savage
to
be
truly
manly.
The
beggar
who,
behind
the
hedge,
divides
his
offals
with
his
dog
has
often
more
of
the
real
sensualist
than
he
who
dines
at
an
elegant
table.
Nor
need
we
hesitate
to
assert,
that
he
who,
unable
to
preserve
a
manly
elegance
of
manners,
degenerates
into
the
_petit
maître_,
would
have
been,
in
any
age
or
condition,
equally
insignificant
and
worthless.
Some,
when
they
talk
of
the
debauchery
of
the
present
age,
seem
to
think
that
the
former
ages
were
all
innocence.
But
this
is
ignorance
of
human
nature.
The
debauchery
of
a
barbarous
age
is
gross
and
brutal;
that
of
a
gloomy,
superstitious
one,
secret,
excessive,
and
murderous;
that
of
a
more
polished
one,
much
happier
for
the
fair
sex,[30]
and
certainly
in
no
sense
so
big
with
political
unhappiness.
If
one
disease
has
been
imported
from
America,[31]
the
most
valuable
medicines
have
likewise
been
brought
from
those
regions;
and
distempers,
which
were
thought
invincible
by
our
forefathers,
are
now
cured.
If
the
luxuries
of
the
Indies
usher
disease
to
our
tables
the
consequence
is
not
unknown;
the
wise
and
the
temperate
receive
no
injury,
and
intemperance
has
been
the
destroyer
of
mankind
in
every
age.
The
opulence
of
ancient
Rome
produced
a
luxury
of
manners
which
proved
fatal
to
that
mighty
empire.
But
the
effeminate
sensualists
of
those
ages
were
not
men
of
intellectual
cultivation.
The
enlarged
ideas,
the
generous
and
manly
feelings
inspired
by
a
liberal
education,
were
utterly
unknown
to
them.
Unformed
by
that
wisdom
which
arises
from
science
and
true
philosophy,
they
were
gross
barbarians,
dressed
in
the
mere
outward
tinsel
of
civilization.[32]
Where
the
enthusiasm
of
military
honour
characterizes
the
rank
of
gentlemen
that
nation
will
rise
into
empire.
But
no
sooner
does
conquest
give
a
continued
security
than
the
mere
soldier
degenerates;
and
the
old
veterans
are
soon
succeeded
by
a
new
generation,
illiterate
as
their
fathers,
but
destitute
of
their
virtues
and
experience.
Polite
literature
not
only
humanizes
the
heart,
but
also
wonderfully
strengthens
and
enlarges
the
mind.
Moral
and
political
philosophy
are
its
peculiar
provinces,
and
are
never
happily
cultivated
without
its
assistance.
But,
where
ignorance
characterizes
the
body
of
the
nobility,
the
most
insipid
dissipation
and
the
very
idleness
and
effeminacy
of
luxury
are
sure
to
follow.
Titles
and
family
are
then
the
only
merit,
and
the
few
men
of
business
who
surround
the
throne
have
it
then
in
their
power
to
aggrandize
themselves
by
riveting
the
chains
of
slavery.
A
stately
grandeur
is
preserved,
but
it
is
only
outward;
all
is
decayed
within,
and
on
the
first
storm
the
weak
fabric
falls
to
the
dust.
Thus
rose
and
thus
fell
the
empire
of
Rome,
and
the
much
wider
one
of
Portugal.
Though
the
increase
of
wealth
did,
indeed,
contribute
to
that
corruption
of
manners
which
unnerved
the
Portuguese,
certain
it
is
the
wisdom
of
legislature
might
certainly
have
prevented
every
evil
which
Spain
and
Portugal
have
experienced
from
their
acquisitions
in
the
two
Indies.[33]
Every
evil
which
they
have
suffered
from
their
acquirements
arose,
as
shall
be
hereafter
demonstrated,
from
their
general
ignorance,
which
rendered
them
unable
to
investigate
or
apprehend
even
the
first
principles
of
civil
and
commercial
philosophy.
And
what
other
than
the
total
eclipse
of
their
glory
could
be
expected
from
a
nobility,
rude
and
unlettered
as
those
of
Portugal
are
described
by
the
author
of
the
Lusiad--a
court
and
nobility
who
sealed
the
truth
of
all
his
complaints
against
them
by
suffering
that
great
man,
the
light
of
their
age,
to
die
in
an
almshouse!
What
but
the
fall
of
their
state
could
be
expected
from
barbarians
like
these!
Nor
can
the
annals
of
mankind
produce
one
instance
of
the
fall
of
empire
where
the
character
of
the
nobles
was
other
than
that
ascribed
to
his
countrymen
by
Camoëns.
MICKLE'S
SKETCH
OF
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
DISCOVERY
OF
INDIA.
No
lesson
can
be
of
greater
national
importance
than
the
history
of
the
rise
and
the
fall
of
a
commercial
empire.
The
view
of
what
advantages
were
acquired,
and
of
what
might
have
been
still
added;
the
means
by
which
such
empire
might
have
been
continued,
and
the
errors
by
which
it
was
lost,
are
as
particularly
conspicuous
in
the
naval
and
commercial
history
of
Portugal
as
if
Providence
had
intended
to
give
a
lasting
example
to
mankind;
a
chart,
where
the
course
of
the
safe
voyage
is
pointed
out,
and
where
the
shelves
and
rocks,
and
the
seasons
of
tempest
are
discovered
and
foretold.
The
history
of
Portugal,
as
a
naval
and
commercial
power,
begins
with
the
designs
of
Prince
Henry.
But
as
the
enterprises
of
this
great
man,
and
the
completion
of
his
designs
are
intimately
connected
with
the
state
of
Portugal,
a
short
view
of
the
progress
of
the
power,
and
of
the
character
of
that
kingdom,
will
be
necessary
to
elucidate
the
history
of
the
revival
of
commerce,
and
the
subject
of
the
Lusiad.
