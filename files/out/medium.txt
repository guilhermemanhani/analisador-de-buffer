[ORIGINAL

TO
THE
DUKE
OF
BUCCLEUGH.
MY
LORD,
The
first
idea
of
offering
my
LUSIAD
to
some
distinguished
personage,
inspired
the
earnest
wish,
that
it
might
be
accepted
by
the
illustrious
representative
of
that
family
under
which
my
father,
for
many
years,
discharged
the
duties
of
a
clergyman.
Both
the
late
Duke
of
BUCCLEUGH,
and
the
Earl
of
DALKEITH,
distinguished
him
by
particular
marks
of
their
favour;
and
I
must
have
forgotten
him,
if
I
could
have
wished
to
offer
the
first
Dedication
of
my
literary
labours
to
any
other
than
the
Duke
of
BUCCLEUGH.
I
am,
with
the
greatest
respect,
My
Lord,
Your
Grace's
most
devoted
And
most
obedient
humble
servant,
WILLIAM
JULIUS
MICKLE.
EDITOR'S
PREFACE.
In
undertaking,
at
the
publishers'
request,
the
function
of
editor
of
Mickle's
Lusiad,
I
have
compared
the
translation
with
the
original,
and,
in
some
places,
where
another
translation
seemed
preferable
to,
or
more
literal
than,
Mickle's,
I
have,
in
addition,
given
that
rendering
in
a
foot-note.
Moreover,
I
have
supplied
the
arguments
to
the
several
cantos,
given
a
few
more
explanatory
notes,
and
added
a
table
of
contents.
"The
late
ingenious
translator
of
the
Lusiad,"
says
Lord
Strangford,[1]
"has
portrayed
the
character,
and
narrated
the
misfortunes
of
our
poet,
in
a
manner
more
honourable
to
his
feelings
as
a
man
than
to
his
accuracy
in
point
of
biographical
detail.
It
is
with
diffidence
that
the
present
writer
essays
to
correct
his
errors;
but,
as
the
real
circumstances
of
the
life
of
Camoëns
are
mostly
to
be
found
in
his
own
minor
compositions,
with
which
Mr.
Mickle
was
unacquainted,
he
trusts
that
certain
information
will
atone
for
his
presumption."
As
Lord
Strangford
professes
to
have
better
and
more
recent
sources
of
information
regarding
the
illustrious,
but
unfortunate,
bard
of
Portugal,
I
make
no
apology
for
presenting
to
the
reader
an
abstract
of
his
lordship's
memoir.
Much
further
information
will
be
found,
however,
in
an
able
article
contained
in
No.
53
of
the
_Quarterly
Review_
for
July,
1822,
from
the
pen,
I
believe,
of
the
poet
Southey.
"The
family
of
Camoëns
was
illustrious,"
says
Lord
Strangford,
"and
originally
Spanish.
They
were
long
settled
at
Cadmon,
a
castle
in
Galicia,
from
which
they
probably
derived
their
patronymic
appellation.
However,
there
are
some
who
maintain
that
their
name
alluded
to
a
certain
wonderful
bird,[2]
whose
mischievous
sagacity
discovered
and
punished
the
smallest
deviation
from
conjugal
fidelity.
A
lady
of
the
house
of
Cadmon,
whose
conduct
had
been
rather
indiscreet,
demanded
to
be
tried
by
this
extraordinary
judge.
Her
innocence
was
proved,
and,
in
gratitude
to
the
being
who
had
restored
him
to
matrimonial
felicity,
the
contented
husband
adopted
his
name."
It
would
appear
that
in
a
dispute
between
the
families
of
Cadmon
and
De
Castera,
a
cavalier
of
the
latter
family
was
slain.
This
happened
in
the
fourteenth
century.
A
long
train
of
persecution
followed,
to
escape
which,
Ruy
de
Camoëns,
having
embraced
the
cause
of
Ferdinand,
removed
with
his
family
into
Portugal,
about
A.D.
1370.
His
son,
Vasco
de
Camoëns,
was
highly
distinguished
by
royal
favour,
and
had
the
honour
of
being
the
ancestor
of
our
poet,
who
descended
from
him
in
the
fourth
generation.
Luia
de
Camoëns,
the
author
of
the
Lusiad,
was
born
at
Lisbon
about
A.D.
1524.
His
misfortunes
began
with
his
birth--he
never
saw
a
father's
smile--for
Simon
Vasco
de
Camoëns
perished
by
shipwreck
in
the
very
year
which
gave
being
to
his
illustrious
son.
The
future
poet
was
sent
to
the
university
of
Coimbra--then
at
the
height
of
its
fame,--"and
maintained
there
by
the
provident
care
of
his
surviving
parent."
"Love,"
says
Lord
Strangford,
"is
very
nearly
allied
to
devotion,
and
it
was
in
the
exercise
of
the
latter,
that
Camoëns
was
introduced
to
the
knowledge
of
the
former.
In
the
Church
of
Christ's
Wounds
at
Lisbon,
on
11th
April,
1542,
Camoëns
first
beheld
Doña
Caterina
de
Atayde,
the
object
of
his
purest
and
earliest
attachment
...
and
it
was
not
long
before
Camoëns
enjoyed
an
opportunity
of
declaring
his
affection,
with
all
the
romantic
ardour
of
eighteen
and
of
a
poet."
The
peculiar
situation
of
the
lady,
as
one
of
the
maids
of
honour
to
the
queen,
imposed
a
restraint
upon
her
admirer
which
soon
became
intolerable;
and
he,
for
having
violated
the
sanctity
of
the
royal
precincts,
was
in
consequence
banished
from
the
court.
Whatever
may
have
been
the
nature
of
his
offence,
"it
furnished
a
pretext
to
the
young
lady's
relations
for
terminating
an
intercourse
which
worldly
considerations
rendered
highly
imprudent."
But
Love
consoled
his
votary:
his
mistress,
on
the
morning
of
his
departure,
confessed
the
secret
of
her
long-concealed
affection,
and
the
sighs
of
grief
were
soon
lost
in
those
of
mutual
delight.
The
hour
of
parting
was,
perhaps,
the
sweetest
of
our
poet's
existence.
Camoëns
removed
to
Santarem,
but
speedily
returned
to
Lisbon,
was
a
second
time
detected,
and
again
driven
into
exile.[3]
The
voice
of
Love
inspired
our
poet
"with
the
glorious
resolution
of
conquering
the
obstacles
which
fortune
had
placed
between
him
and
felicity."
He
obtained
permission,
therefore,
to
accompany
King
John
III.
in
an
expedition
then
fitting
out
against
the
Moors
in
Africa.
In
one
of
the
engagements
with
the
enemy
our
hero
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
"his
right
eye,
by
some
splinters
from
the
deck
of
the
vessel
in
which
he
was
stationed.
Many
of
his
most
pathetic
compositions
were
written
during
this
campaign,
and
the
toils
of
a
martial
life
were
sweetened
by
the
recollection
of
her
for
whose
sake
they
were
endured.
His
heroic
conduct
at
length
procured
his
recall
to
court,"
but
to
find,
alas,
that
his
mistress
was
no
more.
Disappointed
in
his
hope
of
obtaining
any
recognition
of
his
valiant
deeds,
he
now
resolved,
under
the
burning
sun
of
India,
to
seek
that
independence
which
his
own
country
denied.
"The
last
words
I
uttered,"
says
Camoëns,
"on
board
the
vessel
before
leaving,
were
those
of
Scipio:
'Ungrateful
country!
thou
shalt
not
even
possess
my
bones.'"
"Some,"
says
Lord
Strangford,
"attribute
his
departure
to
a
very
different
cause,
and
assert
that
he
quitted
his
native
shores
on
account
of
an
intrigue
in
which
he
was
detected
with
the
beautiful
wife
of
a
Portuguese
gentleman.
Perhaps,"
says
Lord
Strangford,
"this
story
may
not
be
wholly
unfounded."
On
his
arrival
in
India
he
contributed
by
his
bravery
to
the
success
of
an
expedition
carried
on
by
the
King
of
Cochin,
and
his
allies,
the
Portuguese,
against
the
Pimento
Islands;
and
in
the
following
year
(1555)
he
accompanied
Manuel
de
Vasconcelos
in
an
expedition
to
the
Red
Sea.
Here
he
explored
the
wild
regions
of
East
Africa,
and
stored
his
mind
with
ideas
of
scenery,
which
afterwards
formed
some
of
the
most
finished
pictures
of
the
Lusiad.
On
his
return
to
Goa,
Camoëns
devoted
his
whole
attention
to
the
completion
of
his
poem;
but
an
unfortunate
satire
which,
under
the
title
of
_Disparates
na
India_,
or
Follies
in
India,
he
wrote
against
the
vices
and
corruptions
of
the
Portuguese
authorities
in
Goa,
so
roused
the
indignation
of
the
viceroy
that
the
poet
was
banished
to
China.
Of
his
adventures
in
China,
and
the
temporary
prosperity
he
enjoyed
there,
while
he
held
the
somewhat
uncongenial
office
of
_Provedor
dos
defuntos_,
i.e.,
Trustee
for
deceased
persons,
Mickle
has
given
an
ample
account
in
the
introduction
to
the
Lusiad.
During
those
years
Camoëns
completed
his
poem,
about
half
of
which
was
written
before
he
left
Europe.
According
to
a
tradition,
not
improbable
in
itself,
he
composed
great
part
of
it
in
a
natural
grotto
which
commands
a
splendid
view
of
the
city
and
harbour
of
Macao.
An
engraving
of
it
may
be
seen
in
Onseley's
Oriental
Collections,
and
another
will
be
found
in
Sir
G.
Staunton's
Account
of
the
Embassy
to
China.
A
little
temple,
in
the
Chinese
style,
has
been
erected
upon
the
rock,
and
the
ground
around
it
has
been
ornamented
by
Mr.
Fitzhugh,
one
of
our
countrymen,
from
respect
to
the
memory
of
the
poet.
The
years
that
he
passed
in
Macao
were
probably
the
happiest
of
his
life.
Of
his
departure
for
Europe,
and
his
unfortunate
shipwreck
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
Meekhaun,[4]
in
Cochin
China,
Mickle
has
also
given
a
sufficient
account.
Lord
Strangford
has
related,
on
the
authority
of
Sousa,
that
while
our
poet
was
languishing
in
poverty
at
Lisbon,
"a
cavalier,
named
Ruy
de
Camera,
called
on
him
one
day,
asking
him
to
finish
for
him
a
poetical
version
of
the
seven
penitential
psalms.
Raising
his
head
from
his
wretched
pallet,
and
pointing
to
his
faithful
Javanese
attendant,
he
exclaimed,
'Alas,
when
I
was
a
poet,
I
was
young,
and
happy,
and
blest
with
the
love
of
ladies;
but
now
I
am
a
forlorn,
deserted
wretch.
See--there
stands
my
poor
Antonio,
vainly
supplicating
fourpence
to
purchase
a
little
coals--I
have
them
not
to
give
him.'
The
cavalier,
as
Sousa
relates,
closed
both
his
heart
and
his
purse,
and
quitted
the
room.
Such
were
the
grandees
of
Portugal."
Camoëns
sank
under
the
pressure
of
penury
and
disease,
and
died
in
an
alms-house,
early
in
1579,
and
was
buried
in
the
church
of
Sta.
Anna
of
the
Franciscan
Friars.
Over
his
grave
Gonzalo
Coutinho
placed
the
following
inscription:--
"HERE
LIES
LUIS
DE
CAMOËNS.
HE
EXCELLED
ALL
THE
POETS
OF
HIS
TIME.
HE
LIVED
POOR
AND
MISERABLE,
AND
HE
DIED
SO.
MDLXXIX."
The
translator
of
the
Lusiad
was
born,
in
1734,
at
Langholm,
in
Dumfriesshire,
where
his
father,
a
good
French
scholar,
was
the
Presbyterian
minister.
At
the
age
of
sixteen
William
Julius
Mickle
was
removed,
to
his
great
dislike,
from
school,
and
sent
into
the
counting-house
of
a
relation
of
his
mother's,
a
brewer,
where,
against
his
inclination,
he
remained
five
years.
He
subsequently,
for
family
reasons,
became
the
head
of
the
firm,
and
carried
on
the
business.
It
is
not
to
be
wondered
at,
however,
that
with
his
dislike
to
business
in
general
and
to
this
one
in
particular,
he
did
not
succeed;
and
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
cause
of
his
failure,
and
subsequent
pecuniary
embarrassments,
arose
from
his
having
devoted
those
hours
to
his
poetical
studies
which
should
have
been
dedicated
to
business.
Mickle
obtained
afterwards
the
appointment
of
corrector
of
the
Clarendon
Press
in
Oxford,
and
died
at
Wheatly,
in
Oxfordshire,
in
1789.
Southey
speaks
of
Mickle
(_Quarterly
Review_,
liii.
p.
29)
as
a
man
of
genius
who
had
ventured
upon
the
chance
of
living
by
his
literary
labours,
and
says
that
he
"did
not
over-rate
the
powers
which
he
was
conscious
of
possessing,
knew
that
he
could
rely
upon
himself
for
their
due
exertion,
and
had
sufficient
worldly
prudence
to
look
out
for
a
subject
which
was
likely
to
obtain
notice
and
patronage."
His
other
poems,
Pollio,
Sir
Martyn,
etc.,
with
the
exception
of
his
Cumnor
Hall,
are
not
held
in
high
estimation.
Describing
the
several
poetic
versions
of
the
Lusiad,
Mr.
Musgrave
says,[5]
of
Fanshaw's
version,
that
"its
language
is
antiquated,
and
in
many
instances
it
travesties
the
original,
and
seldom
long
sustains
the
tone
of
epic
gravity
suited
to
the
poem.
It
is,
however,"
says
he,
"more
faithful
than
the
translation
of
Mickle,
but
it
would
be
ungenerous,"
he
adds,
"to
dwell
on
the
paraphrastic
licences
which
abound
in
Mickle's
performance,
and
on
its
many
interpolations
and
omissions.
Mr.
Mickle
thought,
no
doubt,"
says
Musgrave,
"that
by
this
process
he
should
produce
a
poem
which
in
its
perusal
might
afford
a
higher
gratification.
Nor
am
I
prepared
to
say
that
by
all
readers
this
would
be
deemed
a
miscalculation.
Let
it
not
be
supposed,
however,
that
I
wish
to
detract
from
the
intrinsic
merit
of
his
translation.
It
is
but
an
act
of
justice
to
admit,
that
it
contains
many
passages
of
exquisite
beauty,
and
that
it
is
a
performance
which
discovers
much
genius,
a
cultivated
taste,
and
a
brilliant
imagination.
Many
parts
of
the
original
are
rendered
with
great
facility,
elegance,
and
fidelity.
In
poetical
elegance
I
presume
not
to
enter
into
competition
with
him."
For
his
own
performance
Musgrave
claims
the
merit
of
greater
fidelity
to
the
original;
but
in
respect
of
harmony,
in
true
poetic
grace,
and
sublimity
of
diction,
his
translation
will
bear
no
comparison
with
Mickle's
version;
for
even
Southey,
in
the
article
before
quoted,
though
very
hard
upon
his
interpolations,
admits
that,
"Mickle
was
a
man
of
genius
...
a
man
whom
we
admire
and
respect;
whose
memory
is
without
a
spot,
and
whose
name
will
live
among
the
English
poets."
(_Quarterly
Review_,
liii.
p.
29.)
It
only
remains
for
me
to
say,
that
in
order
to
place
the
reader
in
a
position
to
judge
of
the
merits
of
this
sublime
effort
of
genius,
I
have
distinguished
Mickle's
longer
interpolations
by
printing
them
in
Bk.
i.
p.
24,
in
_Italics_,
and
in
the
first
300
lines
of
Bk.
ix.
by
calling
the
attention
of
the
reader
to
the
interpolation
by
means
of
a
foot-note.
The
notes
are,
in
general,
left
as
written
by
the
translator,
except
in
some
cases
where
it
seemed
advisable
to
curtail
them.

THE
LIFE
OF
CAMOËNS,
BY
WILLIAM
JULIUS
MICKLE.
When
the
glory
of
the
arms
of
Portugal
had
reached
its
meridian
splendour,
Nature,
as
if
in
pity
of
the
literary
rudeness
of
that
nation,
produced
a
great
poet
to
record
the
numberless
actions
of
high
spirit
performed
by
his
countrymen.
Except
Osorius,
the
historians
of
Portugal
are
little
better
than
dry
journalists.
But
it
is
not
their
inelegance
which
rendered
the
poet
necessary.
It
is
the
peculiar
nature
of
poetry
to
give
a
colouring
to
heroic
actions,
and
to
express
indignation
against
breaches
of
honour,
in
a
spirit
which
at
once
seizes
the
heart
of
the
man
of
feeling,
and
carries
with
it
instantaneous
conviction.
The
brilliant
actions
of
the
Portuguese
form
the
great
hinge
which
opened
the
door
to
the
most
important
alterations
in
the
civil
history
of
mankind.
And
to
place
these
actions
in
the
light
and
enthusiasm
of
poetry--that
enthusiasm
which
particularly
assimilates
the
youthful
breast
to
its
own
fires--was
Luis
de
Camoëns
the
poet
of
Portugal,
born.
Different
cities
have
claimed
the
honour
of
his
birth.
But
according
to
N.
Antonio,
and
Manuel
Correa,
his
intimate
friend,
this
event
happened
at
Lisbon
in
1517.[6]
His
family
was
of
considerable
note,
and
originally
Spanish.
In
1370
Vasco
Perez
de
Caamans,
disgusted
at
the
court
of
Castile,
fled
to
that
of
Lisbon,
where
King
Ferdinand
immediately
admitted
him
into
his
council,
and
gave
him
the
lordships
of
Sardoal,
Punnete,
Marano,
Amendo,
and
other
considerable
lands;
a
certain
proof
of
the
eminence
of
his
rank
and
abilities.
In
the
war
for
the
succession,
which
broke
out
on
the
death
of
Ferdinand,
Caamans
sided
with
the
King
of
Castile,
and
was
killed
in
the
battle
of
Aljabarota.
But
though
John
I.,
the
victor,
seized
a
great
part
of
his
estate,
his
widow,
the
daughter
of
Gonsalo
Tereyro,
grand
master
of
the
Order
of
Christ,
and
general
of
the
Portuguese
army,
was
not
reduced
beneath
her
rank.
She
had
three
sons,
who
took
the
name
of
Camoëns.
The
family
of
the
eldest
intermarried
with
the
first
nobility
of
Portugal,
and
even,
according
to
Castera,
with
the
blood
royal.
But
the
family
of
the
second
brother,
whose
fortune
was
slender,
had
the
superior
honour
to
produce
the
author
of
the
Lusiad.
Early
in
life
the
misfortunes
of
the
poet
began.
In
his
infancy,
Simon
Vaz
de
Camoëns,
his
father,
commander
of
a
vessel,
was
shipwrecked
at
Goa,
where,
with
his
life,
the
greatest
part
of
his
fortune
was
lost.
His
mother,
however,
Anne
de
Macedo
of
Santarem,
provided
for
the
education
of
her
son
Luis,
at
the
University
of
Coimbra.
What
he
acquired
there
his
works
discover;
an
intimacy
with
the
classics,
equal
to
that
of
a
Scaliger,
but
directed
by
the
taste
of
a
Milton
or
a
Pope.
When
he
left
the
university
he
appeared
at
court.
He
was
a
polished
scholar
and
very
handsome,[7]
possessing
a
most
engaging
mien
and
address,
with
the
finest
complexion,
which,
added
to
the
natural
ardour
and
gay
vivacity
of
his
deposition,
rendered
him
an
accomplished
gentleman.
Courts
are
the
scenes
of
intrigue,
and
intrigue
was
fashionable
at
Lisbon.
But
the
particulars
of
the
amours
of
Camoëns
rest
unknown.
This
only
appears:
he
had
aspired
above
his
rank,
for
he
was
banished
from
the
court;
and
in
several
of
his
sonnets
he
ascribes
this
misfortune
to
love.
He
now
retired
to
his
mother's
friends
at
Santarem.
Here
he
renewed
his
studies,
and
began
his
poem
on
the
discovery
of
India.
John
III.
at
this
time
prepared
an
armament
against
Africa.
Camoëns,
tired
of
his
inactive,
obscure
life,
went
to
Ceuta
in
this
expedition,
and
greatly
distinguished
his
valour
in
several
_rencontres_.
In
a
naval
engagement
with
the
Moors
in
the
Straits
of
Gibraltar,
Camoëns,
in
the
conflict
of
boarding,
where
he
was
among
the
foremost,
lost
his
right
eye.
Yet
neither
the
hurry
of
actual
service,
nor
the
dissipation
of
the
camp,
could
stifle
his
genius.
He
continued
his
_Lusiadas_;
and
several
of
his
most
beautiful
sonnets
were
written
in
Africa,
while,
as
he
expresses
it,
"One
hand
the
pen,
and
ant
the
sword
employ'd."
The
fame
of
his
valour
had
now
reached
the
Court,
and
he
obtained
permission
to
return
to
Lisbon.
But
while
he
solicited
an
establishment
which
he
had
merited
in
the
ranks
of
battle,
the
malignity
of
evil
tongues
(as
he
calls
it
in
one
of
his
letters)
was
injuriously
poured
upon
him.
Though
the
bloom
of
his
early
youth
was
effaced
by
several
years
residence
under
the
scorching
sky
of
Africa,
and
though
altered
by
the
loss
of
an
eye,
his
presence
gave
uneasiness
to
the
gentlemen
of
some
families
of
the
first
rank
where
he
had
formerly
visited.
Jealousy
is
the
characteristic
of
the
Spanish
and
Portuguese;
its
resentment
knows
no
bounds,
and
Camoëns
now
found
it
prudent
to
banish
himself
from
his
native
country.
Accordingly,
in
1553
he
hailed
for
India,
with
a
resolution
never
to
return.
As
the
ship
left
the
Tagus
he
exclaimed,
in
the
words
of
the
sepulchral
monument
of
Scipio
Africanus,
"_Ingrata
patria,
non
possidebis
ossa
mea!_"
(Ungrateful
country,
thou
shalt
not
possess
my
bones!)
But
he
knew
not
what
evils
in
the
East
would
awaken
the
remembrance
of
his
native
fields.
When
Camoëns
arrived
in
India,
an
expedition
was
ready
to
sail
to
revenge
the
King
of
Cochin
on
the
King
of
Pimenta.
Without
any
rest
on
shore
after
his
long
voyage,
he
joined
this
armament,
and,
in
the
conquest
of
the
Alagada
Islands,
displayed
his
usual
bravery.
But
his
modesty,
perhaps,
is
his
greatest
praise.
In
a
sonnet
he
mentions
this
expedition:
"We
went
to
punish
the
King
of
Pimenta,"
says
he,
"_e
succedeones
bem_"
(and
we
succeeded
well).
When
it
is
considered
that
the
poet
bore
no
inconsiderable
share
in
the
victory,
no
ode
can
conclude
more
elegantly,
more
happily
than
this.
In
the
year
following,
he
attended
Manuel
de
Vasconcello
in
an
expedition
to
the
Red
Sea.
Here,
says
Faria,
as
Camoëns
had
no
use
for
his
sword,
he
employed
his
pen.
Nor
was
his
activity
confined
to
the
fleet
or
camp.
He
visited
Mount
Felix,
and
the
adjacent
inhospitable
regions
of
Africa,
which
he
so
strongly
pictures
in
the
Lusiad,
and
in
one
of
his
little
pieces,
where
he
laments
the
absence
of
his
mistress.
When
he
returned
to
Goa,
he
enjoyed
a
tranquility
which
enabled
him
to
bestow
his
attention
on
his
epic
poem.
But
this
serenity
was
interrupted,
perhaps
by
his
own
imprudence.
He
wrote
some
satires
which
gave
offence,
and
by
order
of
the
viceroy,
Francisco
Barreto,
he
was
banished
to
China.
Men
of
poor
abilities
are
more
conscious
of
their
embarrassment
and
errors
than
is
commonly
believed.
When
men
of
this
kind
are
in
power,
they
affect
great
solemnity;
and
every
expression
of
the
most
distant
tendency
to
lessen
their
dignity
is
held
as
the
greatest
of
crimes.
Conscious,
also,
how
severely
the
man
of
genius
can
hurt
their
interest,
they
bear
an
instinctive
antipathy
against
him,
are
uneasy
even
in
his
company,
and,
on
the
slightest
pretence,
are
happy
to
drive
him
from
them.
Camoëns
was
thus
situated
at
Goa;
and
never
was
there
a
fairer
field
for
satire
than
the
rulers
of
India
at
that
time
afforded.
Yet,
whatever
esteem
the
prudence
of
Camoëns
may
lose
in
our
idea,
the
nobleness
of
his
disposition
will
doubly
gain.
And,
so
conscious
was
he
of
his
real
integrity
and
innocence,
that
in
one
of
his
sonnets
he
wishes
no
other
revenge
on
Barreto
than
that
the
cruelty
of
his
exile
should
ever
be
remembered.[8]
The
accomplishments
and
manners
of
Camoëns
soon
found
him
friends,
though
under
the
disgrace
of
banishment.
He
was
appointed
Commissary
of
the
estates
of
deceased
persons,
in
the
island
of
Macao,
a
Portuguese
settlement
on
the
coast
of
China.
Here
he
continued
his
Lusiad;
and
here,
also,
after
five
years
residence,
he
acquired
a
fortune,
though
small,
yet
equal
to
his
wishes.
Don
Constantine
de
Braganza
was
now
Viceroy
of
India;
and
Camoëns,
desirous
to
return
to
Goa,
resigned
his
charge.
In
a
ship,
freighted
by
himself,
he
set
sail,
but
was
shipwrecked
in
the
gulf
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
Meekhaun,
in
Cochin
China.
All
he
had
acquired
was
lost
in
the
waves:
his
poems,
which
he
held
in
one
hand,
while
he
swam
with
the
other,
were
all
he
found
himself
possessed
of
when
he
stood
friendless
on
the
unknown
shore.
But
the
natives
gave
him
a
most
humane
reception;
this
he
has
immortalized
in
the
prophetic
song
in
the
tenth
Lusiad;[9]
and
in
the
seventh
he
tells
us
that
here
he
lost
the
wealth
which
satisfied
his
wishes.
_Agora
da
esperança
ja
adquirida,
etc._
"Now
blest
with
all
the
wealth
fond
hope
could
crave,
Soon
I
beheld
that
wealth
beneath
the
wave
For
ever
lost;----
My
life
like
Judah's
Heaven-doom'd
king
of
yore
By
miracle
prolong'd."
On
the
banks
of
the
Meekhaun,
he
wrote
his
beautiful
paraphrase
of
the
137th
Psalm,
where
the
Jews,
in
the
finest
strain
of
poetry,
are
represented
as
hanging
their
harps
on
the
willows
by
the
rivers
of
Babylon,
and
weeping
their
exile
from
their
native
country.
Here
Camoëns
continued
some
time,
till
an
opportunity
offered
to
carry
him
to
Goa.
When
he
arrived
at
that
city,
Don
Constantine
de
Braganza,
the
viceroy,
whose
characteristic
was
politeness,
admitted
him
into
intimate
friendship,
and
Camoëns
was
happy
till
Count
Redondo
assumed
the
government.
Those
who
had
formerly
procured
the
banishment
of
the
satirist
were
silent
while
Constantine
was
in
power.
But
now
they
exerted
all
their
arts
against
him.
Redondo,
when
he
entered
on
office,
pretended
to
be
the
friend
of
Camoëns;
yet,
with
the
most
unfeeling
indifference,
he
suffered
the
innocent
man
to
be
thrown
into
the
common
prison.
After
all
the
delay
of
bringing
witnesses,
Camoëns,
in
a
public
trial,
fully
refuted
every
accusation
against
his
conduct
while
commissary
at
Macao,
and
his
enemies
were
loaded
with
ignominy
and
reproach.
But
Camoëns
had
some
creditors;
and
these
detained
him
in
prison
a
considerable
time,
till
the
gentlemen
of
Goa
began
to
be
ashamed
that
a
man
of
his
singular
merit
should
experience
such
treatment
among
them.
He
was
set
at
liberty;
and
again
he
assumed
the
profession
of
arms,
and
received
the
allowance
of
a
gentleman-volunteer,
a
character
at
that
time
common
in
Portuguese
India.
Soon
after,
Pedro
Barreto
(appointed
governor
of
the
fort
of
Sofála),
by
high
promises,
allured
the
poet
to
attend
him
thither.
The
governor
of
a
distant
fort,
in
a
barbarous
country,
shares
in
some
measure
the
fate
of
an
exile.
Yet,
though
the
only
motive
of
Barreto
was,
in
this
unpleasant
situation,
to
retain
the
conversation
of
Camoëns
at
his
table,
it
was
his
least
care
to
render
the
life
of
his
guest
agreeable.
Chagrined
with
his
treatment,
and
a
considerable
time
having
elapsed
in
vain
dependence
upon
Barreto,
Camoëns
resolved
to
return
to
his
native
country.
A
ship,
on
the
homeward
voyage,
at
this
time
touched
at
Sofála,
and
several
gentlemen[10]
who
were
on
board
were
desirous
that
Camoëns
should
accompany
them.
But
this
the
governor
ungenerously
endeavoured
to
prevent,
and
charged
him
with
a
debt
for
board.
Anthony
de
Cabral,
however,
and
Hector
de
Sylveyra,
paid
the
demand,
and
Camoëns,
says
Faria,
and
the
honour
of
Barreto
were
sold
together.
After
an
absence
of
sixteen
years,
Camoëns,
in
1569,
returned
to
Lisbon,
unhappy
even
in
his
arrival,
for
the
pestilence
then
raged
in
that
city,
and
prevented
his
publishing
for
three
years.
At
last,
in
1572,
he
printed
his
Lusiad,
which,
in
the
opening
of
the
first
book,
in
a
most
elegant
turn
of
compliment,
he
addressed
to
his
prince,
King
Sebastian,
then
in
his
eighteenth
year.
The
king,
says
the
French
translator,
was
so
pleased
with
his
merit,
that
he
gave
the
author
a
pension
of
4000
reals,
on
condition
that
he
should
reside
at
court.
But
this
salary,
says
the
same
writer,
was
withdrawn
by
Cardinal
Henry,
who
succeeded
to
the
crown
of
Portugal,
lost
by
Sebastian
at
the
battle
of
Alcazar.
But
this
story
of
the
pension
is
very
doubtful.
Correa
and
other
contemporary
authors
do
not
mention
it,
though
some
late
writers
have
given
credit
to
it.
If
Camoëns,
however,
had
a
pension,
it
is
highly
probable
that
Henry
deprived
him
of
it.
While
Sebastian
was
devoted
to
the
chase,
his
grand-uncle,
the
cardinal,
presided
at
the
council
board,
and
Camoëns,
in
his
address
to
the
king,
which
closes
the
Lusiad,
advises
him
to
exclude
the
clergy
from
State
affairs.
It
was
easy
to
see
that
the
cardinal
was
here
intended.
And
Henry,
besides,
was
one
of
those
statesmen
who
can
perceive
no
benefit
resulting
to
the
public
from
elegant
literature.
But
it
ought
also
to
be
added
in
completion
of
his
character,
that
under
the
narrow
views
and
weak
hands
of
this
Henry,
the
kingdom
of
Portugal
fell
into
utter
ruin;
and
on
his
death,
which
closed
a
short
inglorious
reign,
the
crown
of
Lisbon,
after
a
faint
struggle,
was
annexed
to
that
of
Spain.
Such
was
the
degeneracy
of
the
Portuguese,
a
degeneracy
lamented
in
vain
by
Camoëns,
whose
observation
of
it
was
imputed
to
him
as
a
crime.
Though
the
great[11]
patron
of
theological
literature--a
species
the
reverse
of
that
of
Camoëns--certain
it
is,
that
the
author
of
the
Lusiad
was
utterly
neglected
by
Henry,
under
whose
inglorious
reign
he
died
in
all
the
misery
of
poverty.
By
some,
it
is
said,
he
died
in
an
almshouse.
It
appears,
however,
that
he
had
not
even
the
certainty
of
subsistence
which
these
houses
provide.
He
had
a
black
servant,
who
had
grown
old
with
him,
and
who
had
long
experienced
his
master's
humanity.
This
grateful
dependant,
a
native
of
Java,
who,
according
to
some
writers,
saved
his
master's
life
in
the
unhappy
shipwreck
where
he
lost
his
effects,
begged
in
the
streets
of
Lisbon
for
the
only
man
in
Portugal
on
whom
God
had
bestowed
those
talents
which
have
a
tendency
to
erect
the
spirit
of
a
downward
age.
To
the
eye
of
a
careful
observer,
the
fate
of
Camoëns
throws
great
light
on
that
of
his
country,
and
will
appear
strictly
connected
with
it.
The
same
ignorance,
the
same
degenerate
spirit,
which
suffered
Camoëns
to
depend
on
his
share
of
the
alms
begged
in
the
streets
by
his
old
hoary
servant--the
same
spirit
which
caused
this,
sank
the
kingdom
of
Portugal
into
the
most
abject
vassalage
ever
experienced
by
a
conquered
nation.
While
the
grandees
of
Portugal
were
blind
to
the
ruin
which
impended
over
them,
Camoëns
beheld
it
with
a
pungency
of
grief
which
hastened
his
end.
In
one
of
his
letters
he
has
these
remarkable
words,
"_Em
fim
accaberey
à
vida,
e
verràm
todos
que
fuy
afeiçoada
a
minho
patria_,"
etc.--"I
am
ending
the
course
of
my
life,
the
world
will
witness
how
I
have
loved
my
country.
I
have
returned,
not
only
to
die
in
her
bosom,
but
to
die
with
her."
In
another
letter,
written
a
little
before
his
death,
he
thus,
yet
with
dignity,
complains,
"Who
has
seen
on
so
small
a
theatre
as
my
poor
bed,
such
a
representation
of
the
disappointments
of
Fortune.
And
I,
as
if
she
could
not
herself
subdue
me,
I
have
yielded
and
become
of
her
party;
for
it
were
wild
audacity
to
hope
to
surmount
such
accumulated
evils."
In
this
unhappy
situation,
in
1579,
in
his
sixty-second
year,
the
year
after
the
fatal
defeat
of
Don
Sebastian,
died
Luis
de
Camoëns,
the
greatest
literary
genius
ever
produced
by
Portugal;
in
martial
courage
and
spirit
of
honour
nothing
inferior
to
her
greatest
heroes.
And
in
a
manner
suitable
to
the
poverty
in
which
he
died
was
he
buried.
Soon
after,
however,
many
epitaphs
honoured
his
memory;
the
greatness
of
his
merit
was
universally
confessed,
and
his
Lusiad
was
translated
into
various
languages.[12]
Nor
ought
it
to
be
omitted,
that
the
man
so
miserably
neglected
by
the
weak
king
Henry,
was
earnestly
enquired
after
by
Philip
of
Spain
when
he
assumed
the
crown
of
Lisbon.
When
Philip
heard
that
Camoëns
was
dead,
both
his
words
and
his
countenance
expressed
his
disappointment
and
grief.
From
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life,
and
from
that
spirit
which
glows
throughout
the
Lusiad,
it
evidently
appears
that
the
courage
and
manners
of
Camoëns
flowed
from
true
greatness
and
dignity
of
soul.
Though
his
polished
conversation
was
often
courted
by
the
great,
he
appears
so
distant
from
servility
that
his
imprudence
in
this
respect
is
by
some
highly
blamed.
Yet
the
instances
of
it
by
no
means
deserve
that
severity
of
censure
with
which
some
writers
have
condemned
him.
Unconscious
of
the
feelings
of
a
Camoëns,
they
knew
not
that
a
carelessness
in
securing
the
smiles
of
fortune,
and
an
open
honesty
of
indignation,
are
almost
inseparable
from
the
enthusiasm
of
fine
imagination.
The
truth
is,
the
man
possessed
of
true
genius
feels
his
greatest
happiness
in
the
pursuits
and
excursions
of
the
mind,
and
therefore
makes
an
estimate
of
things
very
different
from
that
of
him
whose
unremitting
attention
is
devoted
to
his
external
interest.
The
profusion
of
Camoëns
is
also
censured.
Had
he
dissipated
the
wealth
he
acquired
at
Macao,
his
profusion
indeed
had
been
criminal;
but
it
does
not
appear
that
he
ever
enjoyed
any
other
opportunity
of
acquiring
independence.
But
Camoëns
was
unfortunate,
and
the
unfortunate
man
is
viewed--
"Through
the
dim
shade
his
fate
casts
o'er
him:
A
shade
that
spreads
its
evening
darkness
o'er
His
brightest
virtues,
while
it
shows
his
foibles
Crowding
and
obvious
as
the
midnight
stars,
Which,
in
the
sunshine
of
prosperity
Never
had
been
descried."
Yet,
after
the
strictest
discussion,
when
all
the
causes
are
weighed
together,
the
misfortunes
of
Camoëns
will
appear
the
fault
and
disgrace
of
his
age
and
country,
and
not
of
the
man.
His
talents
would
have
secured
him
an
apartment
in
the
palace
of
Augustus,
but
such
talents
are
a
curse
to
their
possessor
in
an
illiterate
nation.
In
a
beautiful,
digressive
exclamation
at
the
end
of
the
Lusiad,
he
affords
us
a
striking
view
of
the
neglect
which
he
experienced.
Having
mentioned
how
the
greatest
heroes
of
antiquity
revered
and
cherished
the
muse,
he
thus
characterizes
the
nobility
of
his
own
age
and
country.
"Alas!
on
Tago's
hapless
shore
alone
The
muse
is
slighted,
and
her
charms
unknown;
For
this,
no
Virgil
here
attunes
the
lyre,
No
Homer
here
awakes
the
hero's
fire;
Unheard,
in
vain
their
native
poet
sings,
And
cold
neglect
weighs
dawn
the
muse's
wings."
In
such
an
age,
and
among
such
a
barbarous
nobility,
what
but
wretched
neglect
could
be
the
fate
of
a
Camoëns!
After
all,
however,
if
he
was
imprudent
on
his
first
appearance
at
the
court
of
John
III.;
if
the
honesty
of
his
indignation
led
him
into
great
imprudence,
as
certainly
it
did,
when
at
Goa
he
satirised
the
viceroy
and
the
first
persons
in
power;
yet
let
it
also
be
remembered,
that
"The
gifts
of
imagination
bring
the
heaviest
task
upon
the
vigilance
of
reason;
and
to
bear
those
faculties
with
unerring
rectitude,
or
invariable
propriety,
requires
a
degree
of
firmness
and
of
cool
attention,
which
doth
not
always
attend
the
higher
gifts
of
the
mind.
Yet,
difficult
as
nature
herself
seems
to
have
rendered
the
task
of
regularity
to
genius,
it
is
the
supreme
consolation
of
dullness
and
of
folly
to
point
with
Gothic
triumph
to
those
excesses
which
are
the
overflowings
of
faculties
they
never
enjoyed.
Perfectly
unconscious
that
they
are
indebted
to
their
stupidity
for
the
consistency
of
their
conduct,
they
plume
themselves
on
an
imaginary
virtue
which
has
its
origin
in
what
is
really
their
disgrace.--Let
such,
if
such
dare
approach
the
shrine
of
Camoëns,
withdraw
to
a
respectful
distance;
and
should
they
behold
the
ruins
of
genius,
or
the
weakness
of
an
exalted
mind,
let
them
be
taught
to
lament
that
nature
has
left
the
noblest
of
her
works
imperfect."[13]
DISSERTATION
ON
THE
LUSIAD,
AND
ON
EPIC
POETRY,
BY
THE
TRANSLATOR.
When
Voltaire
was
in
England,
previous
to
his
publication
of
his
Henriade,
he
published
in
English
an
essay
on
the
epic
poetry
of
the
European
nations.
In
this
he
both
highly
praised,
and
severely
attacked,
the
Lusiad.
In
his
French
editions
of
this
essay,
he
has
made
various
alterations,
at
different
times,
in
the
article
on
Camoëns.
It
is
not,
however,
improper
to
premise,
that
some
most
amazing
falsities
will
be
here
detected;
the
gross
misrepresentation
of
every
objection
refuted;
and
demonstration
brought,
that
when
Voltaire
wrote
his
English
essay,
his
knowledge
of
the
Lusiad
was
entirely
borrowed
from
the
bold,
harsh,
unpoetical
version
of
Fanshaw.
"While
Trissino,"
says
Voltaire,
"was
clearing
away
the
rubbish
in
Italy,
which
barbarity
and
ignorance
had
heaped
up
for
ten
centuries
in
the
way
of
the
arts
and
sciences,
Camoëns,
in
Portugal,
steered
a
new
course,
and
acquired
a
reputation
which
lasts
still
among
his
countrymen
who
pay
as
much
respect
to
his
memory
as
the
English
to
Milton."
Among
other
passages
of
the
Lusiad
which
he
criticises
is
that
where
"Adamastor,
the
giant
of
the
Cape
of
Storms,
appears
to
them,
walking
in
the
depth
of
the
sea;
his
head
reaches
to
the
clouds;
the
storms,
the
winds,
the
thunders,
and
the
lightnings
hang
about
him;
his
arms
are
extended
over
the
waves.
It
is
the
guardian
of
that
foreign
ocean,
unploughed
before
by
any
ship.
He
complains
of
being
obliged
to
submit
to
fate,
and
to
the
audacious
undertaking
of
the
Portuguese,
and
foretells
them
all
the
misfortunes
they
must
undergo
in
the
Indies.
I
believe
that
such
a
fiction
would
be
thought
noble
and
proper
in
all
ages,
and
in
all
nations.
"There
is
another,
which
perhaps
would
have
pleased
the
Italians
as
well
as
the
Portuguese,
but
no
other
nation
besides:
it
is
the
enchanted
island,
called
the
Island
of
Bliss,
which
the
fleet
finds
in
its
way
home,
just
rising
from
the
sea,
for
their
comfort,
and
for
their
reward.
Camoëns
describes
that
place,
as
Tasso
some
years
after
depicted
his
island
of
Armida.
There
a
supernatural
power
brings
in
all
the
beauties,
and
presents
all
the
pleasures
which
nature
can
afford,
and
the
heart
may
wish
for;
a
goddess,
enamoured
with
Vasco
de
Gama,
carries
him
to
the
top
of
a
high
mountain,
from
whence
she
shows
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth,
and
foretells
the
fate
of
Portugal.
"After
Camoëns
hath
given
loose
to
his
fancy,
in
the
description
of
the
pleasures
which
Gama
and
his
crew
enjoyed
in
the
island,
he
takes
care
to
inform
the
reader
that
he
ought
to
understand
by
this
fiction
nothing
but
the
satisfaction
which
the
virtuous
man
feels,
and
the
glory
which
accrues
to
him,
by
the
practice
of
virtue;
but
the
best
excuse
for
such
an
invention
is
the
charming
style
in
which
it
is
delivered
(if
we
may
believe
the
Portuguese),
for
the
beauty
of
the
elocution
sometimes
makes
amends
for
the
faults
of
the
poet,
as
the
colouring
of
Rubens
makes
some
defects
in
his
figures
pass
unregarded.
"There
is
_another_
kind
of
machinery
continued
throughout
all
the
poem,
which
nothing
can
excuse;
that
is,
an
injudicious
mixture
of
the
heathen
gods
with
our
religion.
Gama
in
a
storm
addresses
his
prayers
to
Christ,
but
it
is
Venus
who
comes
to
his
relief;
the
heroes
are
Christians,
and
the
poet
heathen.
The
main
design
which
the
Portuguese
are
supposed
to
have
(next
to
promoting
their
trade)
is
to
propagate
Christianity;
yet
Jupiter,
Bacchus,
and
Venus,
have
in
their
hands
all
the
management
of
the
voyage.
So
incongruous
a
machinery
casts
a
blemish
upon
the
whole
poem;
yet
it
shows
at
the
same
time
how
prevailing
are
its
beauties
since
the
Portuguese
like
it
with
all
its
faults."
The
Lusiad,
says
Voltaire,
contains
"a
sort
of
epic
poetry
unheard
of
before.
No
heroes
are
wounded
a
thousand
different
ways;
no
woman
enticed
away,
and
the
world
overturned
for
her
cause."
But
the
very
want
of
these,
in
place
of
supporting
the
objection
intended
by
Voltaire,
points
out
the
happy
judgment
and
peculiar
excellence
of
Camoëns.
If
Homer
has
given
us
all
the
fire
and
hurry
of
battles,
he
has
also
given
us
all
the
uninteresting,
tiresome
detail.
What
reader
but
must
be
tired
with
the
deaths
of
a
thousand
heroes,
who
are
never
mentioned
before,
nor
afterwards,
in
the
poem.
Yet,
in
every
battle
we
are
wearied
out
with
such
_Gazette_-returns
of
the
slain
and
wounded
as--
"Hector
Priamides
when
Zeus
him
glory
gave,
Assæus
first,
Autonoüs,
he
slew;
Ophites,
Dolops,
Klytis'
son
beside;
Opheltius
also,
Agelaüs
too,
Æsymnus,
and
the
battle-bide
Hippónoüs,
chiefs
on
Danaian
side,
And
then,
the
multitude."
HOMER'S
Iliad,
bk.
xi.
299,
et
seq.,
(W.
G.
T.
BARTER'S
translation.)
And
corresponding
to
it
is
Virgil's
Æneid,
bk.
x.
line
747,
et
seq.:--
"By
Cædicus
Alcathoüs
was
slain;
Sacrator
laid
Hydaspes
on
the
plain;
Orsès
the
strong
to
greater
strength
must
yield,
He,
with
Parthenius,
were
by
Rapo
killed.
Then
brave
Messapus
Ericetès
slew,
Who
from
Lycaón's
blood
his
lineage
drew."
DRYDEN'S
version.
With,
such
catalogues
is
every
battle
extended;
and
what
can
be
more
tiresome
than
such
uninteresting
descriptions,
and
their
imitations!
If
the
idea
of
the
battle
be
raised
by
such
enumeration,
still
the
copy
and
original
are
so
near
each
other
that
they
can
never
please
in
two
separate
poems.
Nor
are
the
greater
part
of
the
battles
of
the
Æneid
much
more
distant
than
those
of
the
Iliad.
Though
Virgil
with
great
art
has
introduced
a
Camilla,
a
Pallas,
and
a
Lausus,
still,
in
many
particulars,
and
in
the
action
upon
the
whole,
there
is
such
a
sameness
with
the
Iliad,
that
the
learned
reader
of
the
Æneid
is
deprived
of
the
pleasure
inspired
by
originality.
If
the
man
of
taste,
however,
will
be
pleased
to
mark
how
the
genius
of
a
Virgil
has
managed
a
war
after
Homer,
he
will
certainly
be
tired
with
a
dozen
epic
poems
in
the
same
style.
Where
the
siege
of
a
town
and
battles
are
the
subject
of
an
epic,
there
will,
of
necessity,
in
the
characters
and
circumstances,
be
a
resemblance
to
Homer;
and
such
poem
must
therefore
want
originality.
Happily
for
Tasso,
the
variation
of
manners,
and
his
masterly
superiority
over
Homer
in
describing
his
duels,
has
given
to
his
Jerusalem
an
air
of
novelty.
Yet,
with
all
the
difference
between
Christian
and
pagan
heroes,
we
have
a
Priam,
an
Agamemnon,
an
Achilles,
etc.,
armies
slaughtered,
and
a
city
besieged.
In
a
word,
we
have
a
handsome
copy
of
the
Iliad
in
the
Jerusalem
Delivered.
If
some
imitations,
however,
have
been
successful,
how
many
other
epics
of
ancient
and
modern
times
have
hurried
down
the
stream
of
oblivion!
Some
of
their
authors
had
poetical
merit,
but
the
fault
was
in
the
choice
of
their
subjects.
So
fully
is
the
strife
of
war
exhausted
by
Homer,
that
Virgil
and
Tasso
could
add
to
it
but
little
novelty;
no
wonder,
therefore,
that
so
many
epics
on
battles
and
sieges
have
been
suffered
to
sink
into
utter
neglect.
Camoëns,
perhaps,
did
not
weigh
these
circumstances,
but
the
strength
of
his
poetical
genius
directed
him.
He
could
not
but
feel
what
it
was
to
read
Virgil
after
Homer;
and
the
original
turn
and
force
of
his
mind
led
him
from
the
beaten
track
of
Helen's
and
Lavinia's,
Achilles's
and
Hector's
sieges
and
slaughters,
where
the
hero
hews
down,
and
drives
to
flight,
whole
armies
with
his
own
sword.
Camoëns
was
the
first
who
wooed
the
modern
Epic
Muse,
and
she
gave
him
the
wreath
of
a
first
lover;
a
sort
of
epic
poetry
unheard
of
before;
or,
as
Voltaire
calls
it,
_une
nouvelle
espèce
d'epopée_;
and
the
grandest
subject
it
is
(of
profane
history)
which
the
world
has
ever
beheld.[14]
A
voyage
esteemed
too
great
for
man
to
dare;
the
adventures
of
this
voyage
through
unknown
oceans
deemed
unnavigable;
the
eastern
world
happily
discovered,
and
for
ever
indissolubly
joined
and
given
to
the
western;
the
grand
Portuguese
empire
in
the
East
founded;
the
humanization
of
mankind,
and
universal
commerce
the
consequence!
What
are
the
adventures
of
an
old,
fabulous
hero's
arrival
in
Britain,
what
are
Greece
and
Latium
in
arms
for
a
woman
compared
to
this!
Troy
is
in
ashes,
and
even
the
Roman
empire
is
no
more.
But
the
effects
of
the
voyage,
adventures,
and
bravery
of
the
hero
of
the
Lusiad
will
be
felt
and
beheld,
and
perhaps
increase
in
importance,
while
the
world
shall
remain.
Happy
in
his
choice,
happy
also
was
the
genius
of
Camoëns
in
the
method
of
pursuing
his
subject.
He
has
not,
like
Tasso,
given
it
a
total
appearance
of
fiction;
nor
has
he,
like
Lucan,
excluded
allegory
and
poetical
machinery.
Whether
he
intended
it
or
not
(for
his
genius
was
sufficient
to
suggest
its
propriety),
the
judicious
precept
of
Petronius[15]
is
the
model
of
the
Lusiad.
That
elegant
writer
proposes
a
poem
on
the
civil
war,
and
no
poem,
ancient
or
modern,
merits
the
character
there
sketched
out
in
any
degree
comparative
to
the
Lusiad.
A
truth
of
history
is
preserved;
yet,
what
is
improper
for
the
historian,
the
ministry
of
Heaven
is
employed,
and
the
free
spirit
of
poetry
throws
itself
into
fictions
which
makes
the
whole
appear
as
an
effusion
of
prophetic
fury,
and
not
like
a
rigid
detail
of
facts,
given
under
the
sanction
of
witnesses.
Contrary
to
Lucan,
who,
in
the
above
rules,
drawn
from
the
nature
of
poetry,
is
severely
condemned
by
Petronius,
Camoëns
conducts
his
poem
_per
ambages
Deorumque
ministeria_.
The
apparition,
which
in
the
night
hovers
athwart
the
fleet
near
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope,
is
the
grandest
fiction
in
human
composition;
the
invention
his
own!
In
the
Island
of
Venus,
the
use
of
which
fiction
in
an
epic
poem
is
also
his
own,
he
has
given
the
completest
assemblage
of
all
the
flowers
which
have
ever
adorned
the
bowers
of
love.
And,
never
was
the
_furentis
animi
vaticinatio_
more
conspicuously
displayed
than
in
the
prophetic
song,
the
view
of
the
spheres,
and
the
globe
of
the
earth.
Tasso's
imitation
of
the
Island
of
Venus
is
not
equal
to
the
original;
and,
though
"Virgil's
myrtles[16]
dropping
blood
are
nothing
to
Tasso's
enchanted
forest,"
what
are
all
Ismeno's
enchantments
to
the
grandeur
and
horror
of
the
appearance,
prophecy,
and
vanishment
of
the
spectre
of
Camoëns![17]
It
has
long
been
agreed
among
critics,
that
the
solemnity
of
religious
observances
gives
great
dignity
to
the
historical
narrative
of
epic
poetry.
Camoëns,
in
the
embarkation
of
the
fleet,
and
in
several
other
places,
is
peculiarly
happy
in
the
dignity
of
religious
allusions.
Manners
and
character
are
also
required
in
the
epic
poem.
But
all
the
epics
which
have
appeared
are,
except
two,
mere
copies
of
the
Iliad
in
these
respects.
Every
one
has
its
Agamemnon,
Achilles,
Ajax,
and
Ulysses;
its
calm,
furious,
gross,
and
intelligent
hero.
Camoëns
and
Milton
happily
left
this
beaten
track,
this
exhausted
field,
and
have
given
us
pictures
of
manners
unknown
in
the
Iliad,
the
Æneid,
and
all
those
poems
which
may
be
classed
with
the
Thebaid.
The
Lusiad
abounds
with
pictures
of
manners,
from
those
of
the
highest
chivalry
to
those
of
the
rudest,
fiercest,
and
most
innocent
barbarism.
In
the
fifth,
sixth,
and
ninth
books,
Leonardo
and
Veloso
are
painted
in
stronger
colours
than
any
of
the
inferior
characters
in
Virgil.
But
_character_,
indeed,
is
not
the
excellence
of
the
Æneid.
That
of
Monzaida,
the
friend
of
Gama,
is
much
superior
to
that
of
Achates.
The
base,
selfish,
perfidious
and
cruel
character
of
the
Zamorim
and
the
Moors,
are
painted
in
the
strongest
colours;
and
the
character
of
Gama
himself
is
that
of
the
finished
hero.
His
cool
command
of
his
passions,
his
deep
sagacity,
his
fixed
intrepidity,
his
tenderness
of
heart,
his
manly
piety,
and
his
high
enthusiasm
in
the
love
of
his
country
are
all
displayed
in
the
superlative
degree.
Let
him
who
objects
the
want
of
character
to
the
Lusiad,
beware
lest
he
stumble
upon
its
praise;
lest
he
only
say,
it
wants
an
Achilles,
a
Hector,
and
a
Priam.
And,
to
the
novelty
of
the
manners
of
the
Lusiad
let
the
novelty
of
fire-arms
also
be
added.
It
has
been
said
that
the
buckler,
the
bow,
and
the
spear,
must
continue
the
arms
of
poetry.
Yet,
however
unsuccessful
others
may
have
been,
Camoëns
has
proved
that
fire-arms
may
be
introduced
with
the
greatest
dignity,
and
the
finest
effect
in
the
epic
poem.
As
the
grand
interest
of
commerce
and
of
mankind
forms
the
subject
of
the
Lusiad,
so,
with
great
propriety,
as
necessary
accompaniments
to
the
voyage
of
his
hero,
the
author
has
given
poetical
pictures
of
the
four
parts
of
the
world--in
the
third
book
a
view
of
Europe;
in
the
fifth,
a
view
of
Africa;
and
in
the
tenth,
a
picture
of
Asia
and
America.
Homer
and
Virgil
have
been
highly
praised
for
their
judgment
in
the
choice
of
subjects
which
interested
their
countrymen,
and
Statius
has
been
as
severely
condemned
for
his
uninteresting
choice.
But,
though
the
subject
of
Camoëns
be
particularly
interesting
to
his
own
countrymen,
it
has
also
the
peculiar
happiness
to
be
the
poem
of
every
trading
nation.
It
is
the
epic
poem
of
the
birth
of
commerce,
and,
in
a
particular
manner,
the
epic
poem
of
whatever
country
has
the
control
and
possession
of
the
commerce
of
India.[18]
An
unexhausted
fertility
and
variety
of
poetical
description,
an
unexhausted
elevation
of
sentiment,
and
a
constant
tenor
of
the
grand
simplicity
of
diction,
complete
the
character
of
the
Lusiad
of
Camoëns:
a
poem
which,
though
it
has
hitherto
received
from
the
public
most
unmerited
neglect,
and
from
the
critics
most
flagrant
injustice,
was
yet
better
understood
by
the
greatest
poet
of
Italy.
Tasso
never
did
his
judgment
more
credit
than
when
he
confessed
that
he
dreaded
Camoëns
as
a
rival;
or
his
generosity
more
honour
than
when
he
addressed
the
elegant
sonnet
to
the
hero
of
the
Lusiad,
commencing--
"Vasco,
le
cui
felici,
ardite
antenne
In
contro
al
sol,
che
ne
riporta
il
giorno."
It
only
remains
to
give
some
account
of
the
version
of
the
Lusiad
which
is
now
offered
to
the
public.
Beside
the
translations
mentioned
in
the
life
of
Camoëns,
M.
Duperron
De
Castera,
in
1735,
gave,
in
French
prose,
a
loose
unpoetical
paraphrase[19]
of
the
Lusiad.
Nor
does
Sir
Richard
Fanshaw's
English
version,
published
during
the
usurpation
of
Cromwell,
merit
a
better
character.
Though
stanza
be
rendered
for
stanza,
though
at
first
view
it
has
the
appearance
of
being
exceedingly
literal,
this
version
is
nevertheless
exceedingly
unfaithful.
Uncountenanced
by
his
original,
Fanshaw--
"Teems
with
many
a
dead-born
just."[20]
Nor
had
he
the
least
idea
of
the
dignity
of
the
epic
style,[21]
or
of
the
true
spirit
of
poetical
translation.
For
this,
indeed,
no
definite
rule
can
be
given.
The
translator's
feelings
alone
must
direct
him,
for
the
spirit
of
poetry
is
sure
to
evaporate
in
literal
translation.
Indeed,
literal
translation
of
poetry
is
a
solecism.
You
may
construe
your
author,
indeed,
but,
if
with
some
translators
you
boast
that
you
have
left
your
author
to
speak
for
himself,
that
you
have
neither
added
nor
diminished,
you
have
in
reality
grossly
abused
him,
and
deceived
yourself.
Your
literal
translation
can
have
no
claim
to
the
original
felicities
of
expression;
the
energy,
elegance,
and
fire
of
the
original
poetry.
It
may
bear,
indeed,
a
resemblance;
but
such
a
one
as
a
corpse
in
the
sepulchre
bears
to
the
former
man
when
he
moved
in
the
bloom
and
vigour
of
life.
_Nec
verbum
verbo
curabis
reddere,
fidus
Interpres,_
was
the
taste
of
the
Augustan
age.
None
but
a
poet
can
translate
a
poet.
The
freedom
which
this
precept
gives,
will,
therefore,
in
a
poet's
hands,
not
only
infuse
the
energy,
elegance,
and
fire
of
his
author's
poetry
into
his
own
version,
but
will
give
it
also
the
spirit
of
an
original.
He
who
can
construe
may
perform
all
that
is
claimed
by
the
literal
translator.
He
who
attempts
the
manner
of
translation
prescribed
by
Horace,
ventures
upon
a
task
of
genius.
Yet,
however
daring
the
undertaking,
and
however
he
may
have
failed
in
it,
the
translator
acknowledges,
that
in
this
spirit
he
has
endeavoured
to
give
the
Lusiad
in
English.
Even
farther
liberties,
in
one
or
two
instances,
seemed
to
him
advantageous----
But
a
minuteness[22]
in
the
mention
of
these
will
not
appear
with
a
good
grace
in
this
edition
of
his
work;
and
besides,
the
original
is
in
the
hands
of
the
world.
MICKLE'S
INTRODUCTION
TO
THE
LUSIAD.
If
a
concatenation
of
events
centred
in
one
great
action--events
which
gave
birth
to
the
present
commercial
system
of
the
world--if
these
be
of
the
first
importance
in
the
civil
history
of
mankind,
then
the
Lusiad,
of
all
other
poems,
challenges
the
attention
of
the
philosopher,
the
politician,
and
the
gentleman.
In
contradistinction
to
the
Iliad
and
the
Æneid,
the
Paradise
Lost
has
been
called
the
Epic
Poem
of
Religion.
In
the
same
manner
may
the
Lusiad
be
named
the
Epic
Poem
of
Commerce.
The
happy
completion
of
the
most
important
designs
of
Henry,
Duke
of
Viseo,
prince
of
Portugal,
to
whom
Europe
owes
both
Gama
and
Columbus,
both
the
eastern
and
the
western
worlds,
constitutes
the
subject
of
this
celebrated
epic
poem.
But
before
we
proceed
to
the
historical
introduction
necessary
to
elucidate
a
poem
founded
on
such
an
important
period
of
history,
some
attention
is
due
to
the
opinion
of
those
theorists
in
political
philosophy
who
lament
that
India
was
ever
discovered,
and
who
assert
that
increase
of
trade
is
only
the
parent
of
degeneracy,
and
the
nurse
of
every
vice.
Much,
indeed,
may
be
urged
on
this
side
of
the
question;
but
much,
also,
may
be
urged
against
every
institution
relative
to
man.
Imperfection,
if
not
necessary
to
humanity,
is
at
least
the
certain
attendant
on
everything
human.
Though
some
part
of
the
traffic
with
many
countries
resemble
Solomon's
importation
of
apes
and
peacocks;
though
the
superfluities
of
life,
the
baubles
of
the
opulent,
and
even
the
luxuries
which
enervate
the
irresolute
and
administer
disease,
are
introduced
by
the
intercourse
of
navigation,
yet
the
extent
of
the
benefits
which
attend
it
are
also
to
be
considered
before
the
man
of
cool
reason
will
venture
to
pronounce
that
the
world
is
injured,
and
rendered
less
virtuous
and
happy
by
the
increase
of
commerce.
If
a
view
of
the
state
of
mankind,
where
commerce
opens
no
intercourse
between
nation
and
nation
be
neglected,
unjust
conclusions
will
certainly
follow.
Where
the
state
of
barbarians,
and
of
countries
under
different
degrees
of
civilization
are
candidly
weighed,
we
may
reasonably
expect
a
just
decision.
As
evidently
as
the
appointment
of
nature
gives
pasture
to
the
herds,
so
evidently
is
man
born
for
society.
As
every
other
animal
is
in
its
natural
state
when
in
the
situation
which
its
instinct
requires,
so
man,
when
his
reason
is
cultivated,
is
then,
and
only
then,
in
the
state
proper
to
his
nature.
The
life
of
the
naked
savage,
who
feeds
on
acorns
and
sleeps
like
a
beast
in
his
den,
is
commonly
called
the
natural
state
of
man;
but,
if
there
be
any
propriety
in
this
assertion,
his
rational
faculties
compose
no
part
of
his
nature,
and
were
given
not
to
be
used.
If
the
savage,
therefore,
live
in
a
state
contrary
to
the
appointment
of
nature,
it
must
follow
that
he
is
not
so
happy
as
nature
intended
him
to
be.
And
a
view
of
his
true
character
will
confirm
this
conclusion.
The
reveries,
the
fairy
dreams
of
a
Rousseau,
may
figure
the
paradisaical
life
of
a
Hottentot,
but
it
is
only
in
such
dreams
that
the
superior
happiness
of
the
barbarian
exists.
The
savage,
it
is
true,
is
reluctant
to
leave
his
manner
of
life;
but,
unless
we
allow
that
he
is
a
proper
judge
of
the
modes
of
living,
his
attachment
to
his
own
by
no
means
proves
that
he
is
happier
than
he
might
otherwise
have
been.
His
attachment
only
exemplifies
the
amazing
power
of
habit
in
reconciling
the
human
breast
to
the
most
uncomfortable
situations.
If
the
intercourse
of
mankind
in
some
instances
be
introductive
of
vice,
the
want
of
it
as
certainly
excludes
the
exertion
of
the
noblest
virtues;
and,
if
the
seeds
of
virtue
are
indeed
in
the
heart,
they
often
lie
dormant,
and
even
unknown
to
the
savage
possessor.
The
most
beautiful
description
of
a
tribe
of
savages
(which
we
may
be
assured
is
from
real
life)
occurs
in
these
words:[23]
And
the
five
spies
of
Dan
"came
to
Laish,
and
saw
the
people
that
were
there,
how
they
dwelt
careless,
after
the
manner
of
the
Zidonians,
quiet
and
secure;
and
there
was
no
magistrate
in
the
land,
that
might
put
them
to
shame
in
anything...."
And
the
spies
said
to
their
brethren,
"Arise,
that
we
may
go
up
against
them;
for
we
have
seen
the
land,
and,
behold,
it
is
very
good....
And
they
came
unto
Laish,
unto
a
people
that
were
at
quiet
and
secure:
and
they
smote
them
with
the
edge
of
the
sword,
and
burnt
the
city
with
fire.
And
there
was
no
deliverer,
because
it
was
far
from
Zidon,
and
they
had
no
business
with
any
man."
However
the
happy
simplicity
of
this
society
may
please
the
man
of
fine
imagination,
the
true
philosopher
will
view
the
men
of
Laish
with
other
eyes.
However
virtuous
he
may
suppose
one
generation,
it
requires
an
alteration
of
human
nature
to
preserve
the
children
of
the
next
in
the
same
generous
estrangement
from
the
selfish
passions--from
those
passions
which
are
the
parents
of
the
acts
of
injustice.
When
his
wants
are
easily
supplied,
the
manners
of
the
savage
will
be
simple,
and
often
humane,
for
the
human
heart
is
not
vicious
without
objects
of
temptation.
But
these
will
soon
occur;
he
that
gathers
the
greatest
quantity
of
fruit
will
be
envied
by
the
less
industrious.
The
uninformed
mind
seems
insensible
of
the
idea
of
the
right
of
possession
which
the
labour
of
acquirement
gives.
When
want
is
pressing,
and
the
supply
at
hand,
the
only
consideration
with
such
minds
is
the
danger
of
seizing
it;
and
where
there
is
no
magistrate
to
put
to
shame
in
anything,
depredation
will
soon
display
all
its
horrors.
Let
it
even
be
admitted
that
the
innocence
of
the
men
of
Laish
could
secure
them
from
the
consequences
of
their
own
unrestrained
desires,
could
even
this
impossibility
be
surmounted,
still
are
they
a
wretched
prey
to
the
first
invaders,
and
because
they
have
no
business
with
any
man,
they
will
find
no
deliverer.
While
human
nature
is
the
same,
the
fate
of
Laish
will
always
be
the
fate
of
the
weak
and
defenceless;
and
thus
the
most
amiable
description
of
savage
life
raises
in
our
minds
the
strongest
imagery
of
the
misery
and
impossible
continuance
of
such
a
state.
But
if
the
view
of
these
innocent
people
terminate
in
horror,
with
what
contemplation
shall
we
behold
the
wilds
of
Africa
and
America?
The
tribes
of
America,
it
is
true,
have
degrees
of
policy
greatly
superior
to
anything
understood
by
the
men
of
Laish.
Great
masters
of
martial
oratory,
their
popular
assemblies
are
schools
open
to
all
their
youth.
In
these
they
not
only
learn
the
history
of
their
nation,
and
what
they
have
to
fear
from
the
strength
and
designs
of
their
enemies,
but
they
also
imbibe
the
most
ardent
spirit
of
war.
The
arts
of
stratagem
are
their
study,
and
the
most
athletic
exercises
of
the
field
their
employment
and
delight;
and,
what
is
their
greatest
praise,
they
have
magistrates
"to
put
them
to
shame."
They
inflict
no
corporeal
punishment
on
their
countrymen,
it
is
true;
but
a
reprimand
from
an
elder,
delivered
in
the
assembly,
is
esteemed
by
them
a
deeper
degradation
and
severer
punishment
than
any
of
those
too
often
most
impolitically
adopted
by
civilized
nations.
Yet,
though
possessed
of
this
advantage--an
advantage
impossible
to
exist
in
a
large
commercial
empire--and
though
masters
of
great
martial
policy,
their
condition,
upon
the
whole,
is
big
with
the
most
striking
demonstration
of
the
misery
and
unnatural
state
of
such
very
imperfect
civilization.
"Multiply
and
replenish
the
earth"
is
an
injunction
of
the
best
political
philosophy
ever
given
to
man.
Nature
has
appointed
man
to
cultivate
the
earth,
to
increase
in
number
by
the
food
which
its
culture
gives,
and
by
this
increase
of
brethren
to
remove
some,
and
to
mitigate
all,
the
natural
miseries
of
human
life.
But
in
direct
opposition
to
this
is
the
political
state
of
the
wild
aborigines
of
America.
Their
lands,
luxuriant
in
climate,
are
often
desolate
wastes,
where
thousands
of
miles
hardly
support
a
few
hundreds
of
savage
hunters.
Attachment
to
their
own
tribe
constitutes
their
highest
idea
of
virtue;
but
this
virtue
includes
the
most
brutal
depravity,
makes
them
esteem
the
man
of
every
other
tribe
as
an
enemy,
as
one
with
whom
nature
had
placed
them
in
a
state
of
war,
and
had
commanded
to
destroy.[24]
And
to
this
principle
their
customs
and
ideas
of
honour
serve
as
rituals
and
ministers.
The
cruelties
practised
by
the
American
savages
on
their
prisoners
of
war
(and
war
is
their
chief
employment)
convey
every
idea
expressed
by
the
word
diabolical,
and
give
a
most
shocking
view
of
the
degradation
of
human
nature.
But
what
peculiarly
completes
the
character
of
the
savage
is
his
horrible
superstition.
In
the
most
distant
nations
the
savage
is,
in
this
respect,
the
same.
The
terror
of
evil
spirits
continually
haunts
him;
his
God
is
beheld
as
a
relentless
tyrant,
and
is
worshipped
often
with
cruel
rites,
always
with
a
heart
full
of
horror
and
fear.
In
all
the
numerous
accounts
of
savage
worship,
one
trace
of
filial
dependence
is
not
to
be
found.
The
very
reverse
of
that
happy
idea
is
the
hell
of
the
ignorant
mind.
Nor
is
this
barbarism
confined
alone
to
those
ignorant
tribes
whom
we
call
savages.
The
vulgar
of
every
country
possess
it
in
certain
degrees,
proportionated
to
their
opportunities
of
conversation
with
the
more
enlightened.
Sordid
disposition
and
base
ferocity,
together
with
the
most
unhappy
superstition,
are
everywhere
the
proportionate
attendants
of
ignorance
and
severe
want.
And
ignorance
and
want
are
only
removed
by
intercourse
and
the
offices
of
society.
So
self-evident
are
these
positions,
that
it
requires
an
apology
for
insisting
upon
them;
but
the
apology
is
at
hand.
He
who
has
read
knows
how
many
eminent
writers,[25]
and
he
who
has
conversed
knows
how
many
respectable
names,
connect
the
idea
of
innocence
and
happiness
with
the
life
of
the
savage
and
the
unimproved
rustic.
To
fix
the
character
of
the
savage
is
therefore
necessary,
ere
we
examine
the
assertion,
that
"it
had
been
happy
for
both
the
old
and
the
new
worlds
if
the
East
and
West
Indies
had
never
been
discovered."
The
bloodshed
and
the
attendant
miseries
which
the
unparalleled
rapine
and
cruelties
of
the
Spaniards
spread
over
the
new
world,
indeed
disgrace
human
nature.
The
great
and
flourishing
empires
of
Mexico
and
Peru,
steeped
in
the
blood
of
forty
millions
of
their
sons,
present
a
melancholy
prospect,
which
must
excite
the
indignation
of
every
good
heart.
Yet
such
desolation
is
not
the
certain
consequence
of
discovery.
And,
even
should
we
allow
that
the
depravity
of
human
nature
is
so
great
that
the
avarice
of
the
merchant
and
rapacity
of
the
soldier
will
overwhelm
with
misery
every
new-discovered
country,
still,
are
there
other,
more
comprehensive
views,
to
be
taken,
ere
we
decide
against
the
intercourse
introduced
by
navigation.
When
we
weigh
the
happiness
of
Europe
in
the
scale
of
political
philosophy,
we
are
not
to
confine
our
eye
to
the
dreadful
ravages
of
Attila
the
Hun,
or
of
Alaric
the
Goth.
If
the
waters
of
a
stagnated
lake
are
disturbed
by
the
spade
when
led
into
new
channels,
we
ought
not
to
inveigh
against
the
alteration
because
the
waters
are
fouled
at
the
first;
we
are
to
wait
to
see
the
streamlets
refine
and
spread
beauty
and
utility
through
a
thousand
vales
which
they
never
visited
before.
Such
were
the
conquests
of
Alexander,
temporary
evils,
but
civilization
and
happiness
followed
in
the
bloody
track.
And,
though
disgraced
with
every
barbarity,
happiness
has
also
followed
the
conquests
of
the
Spaniards
in
the
other
hemisphere.
Though
the
villainy
of
the
Jesuits
defeated
their
schemes
of
civilization
in
many
countries,
the
labours
of
that
society
have
been
crowned
with
a
success
in
Paraguay
and
in
Canada,
which
reflects
upon
their
industry
the
greatest
honour.
The
customs
and
cruelties
of
many
American
tribes
still
disgrace
human
nature,
but
in
Paraguay
and
Canada
the
natives
have
been
brought
to
relish
the
blessings
of
society,
and
the
arts
of
virtuous
and
civil
life.
If
Mexico
is
not
so
populous
as
it
once
was,
neither
is
it
so
barbarous;[26]
the
shrieks
of
the
human
victim
do
not
now
resound
from
temple
to
temple,
nor
does
the
human
heart,
held
up
reeking
to
the
sun,
imprecate
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
on
the
guilty
empire.
And,
however
impolitically
despotic
the
Spanish
governments
may
be,
still
do
these
colonies
enjoy
the
opportunities
of
improvement,
which
in
every
age
arise
from
the
knowledge
of
commerce
and
of
letters--opportunities
which
were
never
enjoyed
in
South
America
under
the
reigns
of
Montezuma
and
Atabalipa.
But
if
from
Spanish,
we
turn
our
eyes
to
British
America,
what
a
glorious
prospect!
Here,
formerly,
on
the
wild
lawn,
perhaps
twice
in
the
year,
a
few
savage
hunters
kindled
their
evening
fire,
kindled
it
more
to
protect
them
from
evil
spirits
and
beasts
of
prey,
than
from
the
cold,
and
with
their
feet
pointed
to
it,
slept
on
the
ground.
Here,
now,
population
spreads
her
thousands,
and
society
appears
in
all
its
blessings
of
mutual
help,
and
the
mutual
lights
of
intellectual
improvement.
"What
work
of
art,
or
power,
or
public
utility,
has
ever
equalled
the
glory
of
having
peopled
a
continent,
without
guilt
or
bloodshed,
with
a
multitude
of
free
and
happy
commonwealths;
to
have
given
them
the
best
arts
of
life
and
government!"
To
have
given
a
savage
continent
an
image
of
the
British
Constitution
is,
indeed,
the
greatest
glory
of
the
British
crown,
"a
greater
than
any
other
nation
ever
acquired;"
and
from
the
consequences
of
the
genius
of
Henry,
Duke
of
Viseo,
did
the
British
American
empire
arise,
an
empire
which,
unless
retarded
by
the
illiberal
and
inhuman
spirit
of
religious
fanaticism,
will
in
a
few
centuries,
perhaps,
be
the
glory
of
the
world.
Stubborn
indeed
must
be
the
theorist
who
will
deny
the
improvement,
virtue,
and
happiness
which,
in
the
result,
the
voyage
of
Columbus
has
spread
over
the
western
world.
The
happiness
which
Europe
and
Asia
have
received
from
the
intercourse
with
each
other,
cannot
hitherto,
it
must
be
owned,
be
compared
either
with
the
possession
of
it,
or
the
source
of
its
increase
established
in
America.
Yet,
let
the
man
of
the
most
melancholy
views
estimate
all
the
wars
and
depredations
which
are
charged
upon
the
Portuguese
and
other
European
nations,
still
will
the
eastern
world
appear
considerably
advantaged
by
the
voyage
of
Gama.
If
seas
of
blood
have
been
shed
by
the
Portuguese,
nothing
new
was
introduced
into
India.
War
and
depredation
were
no
unheard-of
strangers
on
the
banks
of
the
Ganges,
nor
could
the
nature
of
the
civil
establishments
of
the
eastern
nations
secure
a
lasting
peace.
The
ambition
of
their
native
princes
was
only
diverted
into
new
channels,
into
channels
which,
in
the
natural
course
of
human
affairs,
will
certainly
lead
to
permanent
governments,
established
on
improved
laws
and
just
dominion.
Yet,
even
ere
such
governments
are
formed,
is
Asia
no
loser
by
the
arrival
of
Europeans.
The
horrid
massacres
and
unbounded
rapine
which,
according
to
their
own
annals,
followed
the
victories
of
their
Asian
conquerors
were
never
equalled
by
the
worst
of
their
European
vanquishers.
Nor
is
the
establishment
of
improved
governments
in
the
East
the
dream
of
theory.
The
superiority
of
the
civil
and
military
arts
of
the
British,
notwithstanding
the
hateful
character
of
some
individuals,
is
at
this
day
beheld
in
India
with
all
the
astonishment
of
admiration;
and
admiration
is
always
followed,
though
often
with
retarded
steps,
by
the
strong
desire
of
similar
improvement.
Long
after
the
fall
of
the
Roman
empire
the
Roman
laws
were
adopted
by
nations
which
ancient
Rome
esteemed
as
barbarous.
And
thus,
in
the
course
of
ages,
the
British
laws,
according
to
every
test
of
probability,
will
have
a
most
important
effect,
will
fulfil
the
prophecy
of
Camoëns,
and
transfer
to
the
British
the
high
compliment
he
pays
to
his
countrymen--
"Beneath
their
sway
majestic,
wise,
and
mild,
Proud
of
her
victor's
laws
thrice
happier
India
smiled."
In
former
ages,
and
within
these
few
years,
the
fertile
empire
of
India
has
exhibited
every
scene
of
human
misery,
under
the
undistinguishing
ravages
of
their
Mohammedan
and
native
princes;
ravages
only
equalled
in
European
history
by
those
committed
under
Atilla,
surnamed
"the
scourge
of
God,"
and
"the
destroyer
of
nations."
The
ideas
of
patriotism
and
of
honour
were
seldom
known
in
the
cabinets
of
the
eastern
princes
till
the
arrival
of
the
Europeans.
Every
species
of
assassination
was
the
policy
of
their
courts,
and
every
act
of
unrestrained
rapine
and
massacre
followed
the
path
of
victory.
But
some
of
the
Portuguese
governors,
and
many
of
the
English
officers,
have
taught
them
that
humanity
to
the
conquered
is
the
best,
the
truest
policy.
The
brutal
ferocity
of
their
own
conquerors
is
now
the
object
of
their
greatest
dread;
and
the
superiority
of
the
British
in
war
has
convinced
their
princes,[27]
that
an
alliance
with
the
British
is
the
surest
guarantee
of
their
national
peace
and
prosperity.
While
the
English
East
India
Company
are
possessed
of
their
present
greatness,
it
is
in
their
power
to
diffuse
over
the
East
every
blessing
which
flows
from
the
wisest
and
most
humane
policy.
Long
ere
the
Europeans
arrived,
a
failure
of
the
crop
of
rice,
the
principal
food
of
India,
had
spread
the
devastations
of
famine
over
the
populous
plains
of
Bengal.
And
never,
from
the
seven
years'
famine
of
ancient
Egypt
to
the
present
day,
was
there
a
natural
scarcity
in
any
country
which
did
not
enrich
the
proprietors
of
the
granaries.
The
Mohammedan
princes,
and
Moorish
traders
have
often
added
all
the
horrors
of
an
artificial,
to
a
natural,
famine.
But,
however
some
Portuguese
or
other
governors
may
stand
accused,
much
was
left
for
the
humanity
of
the
more
exalted
policy
of
an
Albuquerque,
or
a
Castro.
And
under
such
European
governors
as
these,
the
distresses
of
the
East
have
often
been
alleviated
by
a
generosity
of
conduct,
and
a
train
of
resources
formerly
unknown
in
Asia.
Absurd
and
impracticable
were
that
scheme
which
would
introduce
the
British
laws
into
India
without
the
deepest
regard
to
the
manners
and
circumstances
peculiar
to
the
people.
But
that
spirit
of
liberty
upon
which
they
are
founded,
and
that
security
of
property
which
is
their
leading
principle,
must
in
time
have
a
wide
and
stupendous
effect.
The
abject
spirit
of
Asiatic
submission
will
be
taught
to
see,
and
to
claim,
those
rights
of
nature,
of
which
the
dispirited
and
passive
Hindus
could,
till
lately,
hardly
form
an
idea.
From
this,
as
naturally
as
the
noon
succeeds
the
dawn,
must
the
other
blessings
of
civilization
arise.
For,
though
the
four
great
castes
of
India
are
almost
inaccessible
to
the
introduction
of
other
manners,
and
of
other
literature
than
their
own,
happily
there
is
in
human
nature
a
propensity
to
change.
Nor
may
the
political
philosopher
be
deemed
an
enthusiast
who
would
boldly
prophesy,
that
unless
the
British
be
driven
from
India
the
general
superiority
which
they
bear
will,
ere
many
generations
shall
have
passed,
induce
the
most
intelligent
of
India
to
break
the
shackles
of
their
absurd
superstitions,[28]
and
lead
them
to
partake
of
those
advantages
which
arise
from
the
free
scope
and
due
cultivation
of
the
rational
powers.
In
almost
every
instance
the
Indian
institutions
are
contrary
to
the
feelings
and
wishes
of
nature.
And
ignorance
and
bigotry,
their
two
chief
pillars,
can
never
secure
unalterable
duration.
We
have
certain
proof
that
the
horrid
custom
of
burning
the
wives
along
with
the
body
of
the
deceased
husband
has
continued
for
upwards
of
fifteen
hundred
years;
we
are
also
certain
that
within
these
twenty
years
it
has
begun
to
fall
into
disuse.
Together
with
the
alteration
of
this
most
striking
feature
of
Indian
manners,
other
assimilations
to
European
sentiments
have
already
taken
place.
Nor
can
the
obstinacy
even
of
the
conceited
Chinese
always
resist
the
desire
of
imitating
the
Europeans,
a
people
who
in
arts
and
arms
are
so
greatly
superior
to
themselves.
The
use
of
the
twenty-four
letters,
by
which
we
can
express
every
language,
appeared
at
first
as
miraculous
to
the
Chinese.
Prejudice
cannot
always
deprive
that
people,
who
are
not
deficient
in
selfish
cunning,
of
the
ease
and
expedition
of
an
alphabet;
and
it
is
easy
to
foresee
that,
in
the
course
of
a
few
centuries,
some
alphabet
will
certainly
take
the
place
of
the
60,000
arbitrary
marks
which
now
render
the
cultivation
of
the
Chinese
literature
not
only
a
labour
of
the
utmost
difficulty,
but
even
the
attainment
impossible
beyond
a
very
limited
degree.
And
from
the
introduction
of
an
alphabet,
what
improvements
may
not
be
expected
from
the
laborious
industry
of
the
Chinese!
Though
most
obstinately
attached
to
their
old
customs,
yet
there
is
a
tide
in
the
manners
of
nations
which
is
sudden
and
rapid,
and
which
acts
with
a
kind
of
instinctive
fury
against
ancient
prejudice
and
absurdity.
It
was
that
nation
of
merchants,
the
Phœnicians,
which
diffused
the
use
of
letters
through
the
ancient,
and
commerce
will
undoubtedly
diffuse
the
same
blessings
through
the
modern,
world.
To
this
view
of
the
political
happiness
which
is
sure
to
be
introduced
in
proportion
to
civilization,
let
the
divine
add
what
may
be
reasonably
expected
from
such
opportunity
of
the
increase
of
religion.
A
factory
of
merchants,
indeed,
has
seldom
been
found
to
be
a
school
of
piety;
yet,
when
the
general
manners
of
a
people
become
assimilated
to
those
of
a
more
rational
worship,
something
more
than
ever
was
produced
by
an
infant
mission,
or
the
neighbourhood
of
an
infant
colony,
may
then
be
reasonably
expected,
and
even
foretold.
In
estimating
the
political
happiness
of
a
people,
nothing
is
of
greater
importance
than
their
capacity
of,
and
tendency
to,
improvement.
As
a
dead
lake,
to
continue
our
former
illustration,
will
remain
in
the
same
state
for
ages
and
ages,
so
would
the
bigotry
and
superstitions
of
the
East
continue
the
same.
But
if
the
lake
is
begun
to
be
opened
into
a
thousand
rivulets,
who
knows
over
what
unnumbered
fields,
barren
before,
they
may
diffuse
the
blessings
of
fertility,
and
turn
a
dreary
wilderness
into
a
land
of
society
and
joy.
In
contrast
to
this,
let
the
Gold
Coast
and
other
immense
regions
of
Africa
be
contemplated--
"Afric
behold;
alas,
what
altered
view!
Her
lands
uncultured,
and
her
sons
untrue;
Ungraced
with
all
that
sweetens
human
life,
Savage
and
fierce
they
roam
in
brutal
strife;
Eager
they
grasp
the
gifts
which
culture
yields,
Yet
naked
roam
their
own
neglected
fields....
Unnumber'd
tribes
as
bestial
grazers
stray,
By
laws
unform'd,
unform'd
by
Reason's
sway.
Far
inward
stretch
the
mournful
sterile
dales,
Where
on
the
parch'd
hill-side
pale
famine
wails."
LUSIAD
X.
Let
us
consider
how
many
millions
of
these
unhappy
savages
are
dragged
from
their
native
fields,
and
cut
off
for
ever
from
all
the
hopes
and
all
the
rights
to
which
human
birth
entitled
them.
And
who
would
hesitate
to
pronounce
that
negro
the
greatest
of
patriots,
who,
by
teaching
his
countrymen
the
arts
of
society,
should
teach
them
to
defend
themselves
in
the
possession
of
their
fields,
their
families,
and
their
own
personal
liberties?
Evident,
however,
as
it
is,
that
the
voyages
of
Gama
and
Columbus
have
already
carried
a
superior
degree
of
happiness,
and
the
promise
of
infinitely
more,
to
the
eastern
and
western
worlds;
yet
the
advantages
to
Europe
from
the
discovery
of
these
regions
may
perhaps
be
denied.
But
let
us
view
what
Europe
was,
ere
the
genius
of
Don
Henry
gave
birth
to
the
spirit
of
modern
discovery.
Several
ages
before
this
period
the
feudal
system
had
degenerated
into
the
most
absolute
tyranny.
The
barons
exercised
the
most
despotic
authority
over
their
vassals,
and
every
scheme
of
public
utility
was
rendered
impracticable
by
their
continual
petty
wars
with
each
other;
to
which
they
led
their
dependents
as
dogs
to
the
chase.
Unable
to
read,
or
to
write
his
own
name,
the
chieftain
was
entirely
possessed
by
the
most
romantic
opinion
of
military
glory,
and
the
song
of
his
domestic
minstrel
constituted
his
highest
idea
of
fame.
The
classic
authors
slept
on
the
shelves
of
the
monasteries,
their
dark
but
happy
asylum,
while
the
life
of
the
monks
resembled
that
of
the
fattened
beeves
which
loaded
their
tables.
Real
abilities
were
indeed
possessed
by
a
Duns
Scotus
and
a
few
others;
but
these
were
lost
in
the
most
trifling
subtleties
of
a
sophistry
which
they
dignified
with
the
name
of
casuistical
divinity.
Whether
Adam
and
Eve
were
created
with
navels?
and
How
many
thousand
angels
might
at
the
same
instant
dance
upon
the
point
of
the
finest
needle
without
one
jostling
another?
were
two
of
the
several
topics
of
like
importance
which
excited
the
acumen
and
engaged
the
controversies
of
the
learned.
While
every
branch
of
philosophical,
of
rational
investigation,
was
thus
unpursued
and
unknown,
commerce,
which
is
incompatible
with
the
feudal
system,
was
equally
neglected
and
unimproved.
Where
the
mind
is
enlarged
and
enlightened
by
learning,
plans
of
commerce
will
rise
into
action,
and
these,
in
return,
will
from
every
part
of
the
world
bring
new
acquirements
to
philosophy
and
science.
The
birth
of
learning
and
commerce
may
be
different,
but
their
growth
is
mutual
and
dependent
upon
each
other.
They
not
only
assist
each
other,
but
the
same
enlargement
of
mind
which
is
necessary
for
perfection
in
the
one
is
also
necessary
for
perfection
in
the
other;
and
the
same
causes
impede,
and
are
alike
destructive
of,
both.
The
INTERCOURSE
of
mankind
is
the
parent
of
each.
According
to
the
confinement
or
extent
of
intercourse,
barbarity
or
civilization
proportionately
prevail.
In
the
dark,
monkish
ages,
the
intercourse
of
the
learned
was
as
much
impeded
and
confined
as
that
of
the
merchant.
A
few
unwieldy
vessels
coasted
the
shores
of
Europe,
and
mendicant
friars
and
ignorant
pilgrims
carried
a
miserable
account
of
what
was
passing
in
the
world
from
monastery
to
monastery.
What
doctor
had
last
disputed
on
the
peripatetic
philosophy
at
some
university,
or
what
new
heresy
had
last
appeared,
not
only
comprised
the
whole
of
their
literary
intelligence,
but
was
delivered
with
little
accuracy,
and
received
with
as
little
attention.
While
this
thick
cloud
of
mental
darkness
overspread
the
western
world,
was
Don
Henry,
prince
of
Portugal,
born;
born
to
set
mankind
free
from
the
feudal
system,
and
to
give
to
the
whole
world
every
advantage,
every
light
that
may
possibly
be
diffused
by
the
intercourse
of
unlimited
commerce:--
"For
then
from
ancient
gloom
emerg'd
The
rising
world
of
trade:
the
genius,
then,
Of
navigation,
that
in
hopeless
sloth
Had
slumber'd
on
the
vast
Atlantic
deep
For
idle
ages,
starting
heard
at
last
The
Lusitanian
prince,
who,
Heaven-inspir'd,
To
love
of
useful
glory
rous'd
mankind,
And
in
unbounded
commerce
mix'd
the
world."
THOMSON.
In
contrast
to
this
melancholy
view
of
human
nature,
sunk
in
barbarism
and
benighted
with
ignorance,
let
the
present
state
of
Europe
be
impartially
estimated.
Yet,
though
the
great
increase
of
opulence
and
learning
cannot
be
denied,
there
are
some
who
assert
that
virtue
and
happiness
have
as
greatly
declined.
And
the
immense
overflow
of
riches,
from
the
East
in
particular,
has
been
pronounced
big
with
destruction
to
the
British
empire.
Everything
human,
it
is
true,
has
its
dark
as
well
as
its
bright
side;
but
let
these
popular
complaints
be
examined,
and
it
will
be
found
that
modern
Europe,
and
the
British
empire
in
a
very
particular
manner,
have
received
the
greatest
and
most
solid
advantages
from
the
modern,
enlarged
system
of
commerce.
The
magic
of
the
old
romances,
which
could
make
the
most
withered,
deformed
hag,
appear
as
the
most
beautiful
virgin,
is
every
day
verified
in
popular
declamation.
Ancient
days
are
there
painted
in
the
most
amiable
simplicity,
and
the
modern
in
the
most
odious
colours.
Yet,
what
man
of
fortune
in
England
lives
in
that
stupendous
gross
luxury
which
every
day
was
exhibited
in
the
Gothic
castles
of
the
old
chieftains!
Four
or
five
hundred
knights
and
squires
in
the
domestic
retinue
of
a
warlike
earl
was
not
uncommon,
nor
was
the
pomp
of
embroidery
inferior
to
the
profuse
waste
of
their
tables;
in
both
instances
unequalled
by
all
the
mad
excesses
of
the
present
age.
While
the
baron
thus
lived
in
all
the
wild
glare
of
Gothic
luxury,
agriculture
was
almost
totally
neglected,
and
his
meaner
vassals
fared
harder,
infinitely
less
comfortably,
than
the
meanest
industrious
labourers
of
England
do
now;
where
the
lands
are
uncultivated,
the
peasants,
ill-clothed,
ill-lodged,
and
poorly
fed,
pass
their
miserable
days
in
sloth
and
filth,
totally
ignorant
of
every
advantage,
of
every
comfort
which
nature
lays
at
their
feet.
He
who
passes
from
the
trading
towns
and
cultured
fields
of
England
to
those
remote
villages
of
Scotland
or
Ireland
which
claim
this
description,
is
astonished
at
the
comparative
wretchedness
of
their
destitute
inhabitants;
but
few
consider
that
these
villages
only
exhibit
a
view
of
what
Europe
was
ere
the
spirit
of
commerce
diffused
the
blessings
which
naturally
flow
from
her
improvements.
In
the
Hebrides
the
failure
of
a
harvest
almost
depopulates
an
island.
Having
little
or
no
traffic
to
purchase
grain,
numbers
of
the
young
and
hale
betake
themselves
to
the
continent
in
quest
of
employment
and
food,
leaving
a
few,
less
adventurous,
behind,
to
beget
a
new
race,
the
heir
of
the
same
fortune.
Yet
from
the
same
cause,
from
the
want
of
traffic,
the
kingdom
of
England
has
often
felt
more
dreadful
effects
than
these.
Even
in
the
days
when
her
Henries
and
Edwards
plumed
themselves
with
the
trophies
of
France,
how
often
has
famine
spread
all
her
horrors
over
city
and
village?
Our
modern
histories
neglect
this
characteristic
feature
of
ancient
days;
but
the
rude
chronicles
of
these
ages
inform
us,
that
three
or
four
times
in
almost
every
reign
was
England
thus
visited.
The
failure
of
the
crop
was
then
severely
felt,
and
two
bad
harvests
in
succession
were
almost
insupportable.
But
commerce
has
now
opened
another
scene,
has
armed
government
with
the
happiest
power
that
can
be
exerted
by
the
rulers
of
a
nation--the
power
to
prevent
every
extremity[29]
which
may
possibly
arise
from
bad
harvests;
extremities,
which,
in
former
ages,
were
esteemed
more
dreadful
visitations
of
the
wrath
of
Heaven
than
the
pestilence
itself.
Yet
modern
London
is
not
so
certainly
defended
against
the
latter,
its
ancient
visitor,
than
the
commonwealth
by
the
means
of
commerce,
under
a
just
and
humane
government,
is
secured
against
the
ravages
of
the
former.
If,
from
these
great
outlines
of
the
happiness
enjoyed
by
a
commercial
over
an
uncommercial
nation,
we
turn
our
eyes
to
the
manners,
the
advantages
will
be
found
no
less
in
favour
of
the
civilized.
Whoever
is
inclined
to
declaim
at
the
vices
of
the
present
age,
let
him
read,
and
be
convinced,
that
the
Gothic
ages
were
less
virtuous.
If
the
spirit
of
chivalry
prevented
effeminacy,
it
was
the
foster-father
of
a
ferocity
of
manners
now
happily
unknown.
Rapacity,
avarice,
and
effeminacy
are
the
vices
ascribed
to
the
increase
of
commerce;
and
in
some
degree,
it
must
be
confessed,
they
follow
her
steps.
Yet
infinitely
more
dreadful,
as
every
palatinate
in
Europe
often
felt,
were
the
effects
of
the
two
first
under
the
feudal
lords
than
can
possibly
be
experienced
under
any
system
of
trade.
The
virtues
and
vices
of
human
nature
are
the
same
in
every
age:
they
only
receive
different
modifications,
and
are
dormant,
or
awakened
into
action,
under
different
circumstances.
The
feudal
lord
had
it
infinitely
more
in
his
power
to
be
rapacious
than
the
merchant.
And
whatever
avarice
may
attend
the
trader,
his
intercourse
with
the
rest
of
mankind
lifts
him
greatly
above
that
brutish
ferocity
which
actuates
the
savage,
often
the
rustic,
and
in
general
characterizes
the
ignorant
part
of
mankind.
The
abolition
of
the
feudal
system,
a
system
of
absolute
slavery,
and
that
equality
of
mankind
which
affords
the
protection
of
property,
and
every
other
incitement
to
industry,
are
the
glorious
gifts
which
the
spirit
of
commerce,
awakened
by
Prince
Henry
of
Portugal,
has
bestowed
upon
Europe
in
general;
and,
as
if
directed
by
the
manes
of
his
mother,
a
daughter
of
England,
upon
the
British
empire
in
particular.
In
the
vice
of
effeminacy
alone,
perhaps,
do
we
exceed
our
ancestors;
yet,
even
here
we
have
infinitely
the
advantage
over
them.
The
brutal
ferocity
of
former
ages
is
now
lost,
and
the
general
mind
is
humanized.
The
savage
breast
is
the
native
soil
of
revenge;
a
vice,
of
all
others,
peculiarly
stamped
with
the
character
of
hell.
But
the
mention
of
this
was
reserved
for
the
character
of
the
savages
of
Europe.
The
savage
of
every
country
is
implacable
when
injured;
but
among
some,
revenge
has
its
measure.
When
an
American
Indian
is
murdered
his
kindred
pursue
the
murderer;
and,
as
soon
as
blood
has
atoned
for
blood,
the
wilds
of
America
hear
the
hostile
parties
join
in
their
mutual
lamentations
over
the
dead,
whom,
as
an
oblivion
of
malice,
they
bury
together.
But
the
measure
of
revenge,
never
to
be
full,
was
left
for
the
demi-savages
of
Europe.
The
vassals
of
the
feudal
lord
entered
into
his
quarrels
with
the
most
inexorable
rage.
Just
or
unjust
was
no
consideration
of
theirs.
It
was
a
family
feud;
no
farther
inquiry
was
made;
and
from
age
to
age,
the
parties,
who
never
injured
each
other,
breathed
nothing
but
mutual
rancour
and
revenge.
And
actions,
suitable
to
this
horrid
spirit,
everywhere
confessed
its
virulent
influence.
Such
were
the
late
days
of
Europe,
admired
by
the
ignorant
for
the
innocence
of
manners.
Resentment
of
injury,
indeed,
is
natural;
and
there
is
a
degree
which
is
honest,
and
though
warm,
far
from
inhuman.
But
if
it
is
the
hard
task
of
humanized
virtue
to
preserve
the
feeling
of
an
injury
unmixed
with
the
slightest
criminal
wish
of
revenge,
how
impossible
is
it
for
the
savage
to
attain
the
dignity
of
forgiveness,
the
greatest
ornament
of
human
nature.
As
in
individuals,
a
virtue
will
rise
into
a
vice,
generosity
into
blind
profusion,
and
even
mercy
into
criminal
lenity,
so
civilized
manners
will
lead
the
opulent
into
effeminacy.
But
let
it
be
considered,
this
consequence
is
by
no
means
the
certain
result
of
civilization.
Civilization,
on
the
contrary,
provides
the
most
effectual
preventive
of
this
evil.
Where
classical
literature
prevails
the
manly
spirit
which
it
breathes
must
be
diffused;
whenever
frivolousness
predominates,
when
refinement
degenerates
into
whatever
enervates
the
mind,
literary
ignorance
is
sure
to
complete
the
effeminate
character.
A
mediocrity
of
virtues
and
of
talents
is
the
lot
of
the
great
majority
of
mankind;
and
even
this
mediocrity,
if
cultivated
by
a
liberal
education,
will
infallibly
secure
its
possessor
against
those
excesses
of
effeminacy
which
are
really
culpable.
To
be
of
plain
manners
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
a
clown,
or
to
wear
coarse
clothes;
nor
is
it
necessary
to
lie
on
the
ground
and
feed
like
the
savage
to
be
truly
manly.
The
beggar
who,
behind
the
hedge,
divides
his
offals
with
his
dog
has
often
more
of
the
real
sensualist
than
he
who
dines
at
an
elegant
table.
Nor
need
we
hesitate
to
assert,
that
he
who,
unable
to
preserve
a
manly
elegance
of
manners,
degenerates
into
the
_petit
maître_,
would
have
been,
in
any
age
or
condition,
equally
insignificant
and
worthless.
Some,
when
they
talk
of
the
debauchery
of
the
present
age,
seem
to
think
that
the
former
ages
were
all
innocence.
But
this
is
ignorance
of
human
nature.
The
debauchery
of
a
barbarous
age
is
gross
and
brutal;
that
of
a
gloomy,
superstitious
one,
secret,
excessive,
and
murderous;
that
of
a
more
polished
one,
much
happier
for
the
fair
sex,[30]
and
certainly
in
no
sense
so
big
with
political
unhappiness.
If
one
disease
has
been
imported
from
America,[31]
the
most
valuable
medicines
have
likewise
been
brought
from
those
regions;
and
distempers,
which
were
thought
invincible
by
our
forefathers,
are
now
cured.
If
the
luxuries
of
the
Indies
usher
disease
to
our
tables
the
consequence
is
not
unknown;
the
wise
and
the
temperate
receive
no
injury,
and
intemperance
has
been
the
destroyer
of
mankind
in
every
age.
The
opulence
of
ancient
Rome
produced
a
luxury
of
manners
which
proved
fatal
to
that
mighty
empire.
But
the
effeminate
sensualists
of
those
ages
were
not
men
of
intellectual
cultivation.
The
enlarged
ideas,
the
generous
and
manly
feelings
inspired
by
a
liberal
education,
were
utterly
unknown
to
them.
Unformed
by
that
wisdom
which
arises
from
science
and
true
philosophy,
they
were
gross
barbarians,
dressed
in
the
mere
outward
tinsel
of
civilization.[32]
Where
the
enthusiasm
of
military
honour
characterizes
the
rank
of
gentlemen
that
nation
will
rise
into
empire.
But
no
sooner
does
conquest
give
a
continued
security
than
the
mere
soldier
degenerates;
and
the
old
veterans
are
soon
succeeded
by
a
new
generation,
illiterate
as
their
fathers,
but
destitute
of
their
virtues
and
experience.
Polite
literature
not
only
humanizes
the
heart,
but
also
wonderfully
strengthens
and
enlarges
the
mind.
Moral
and
political
philosophy
are
its
peculiar
provinces,
and
are
never
happily
cultivated
without
its
assistance.
But,
where
ignorance
characterizes
the
body
of
the
nobility,
the
most
insipid
dissipation
and
the
very
idleness
and
effeminacy
of
luxury
are
sure
to
follow.
Titles
and
family
are
then
the
only
merit,
and
the
few
men
of
business
who
surround
the
throne
have
it
then
in
their
power
to
aggrandize
themselves
by
riveting
the
chains
of
slavery.
A
stately
grandeur
is
preserved,
but
it
is
only
outward;
all
is
decayed
within,
and
on
the
first
storm
the
weak
fabric
falls
to
the
dust.
Thus
rose
and
thus
fell
the
empire
of
Rome,
and
the
much
wider
one
of
Portugal.
Though
the
increase
of
wealth
did,
indeed,
contribute
to
that
corruption
of
manners
which
unnerved
the
Portuguese,
certain
it
is
the
wisdom
of
legislature
might
certainly
have
prevented
every
evil
which
Spain
and
Portugal
have
experienced
from
their
acquisitions
in
the
two
Indies.[33]
Every
evil
which
they
have
suffered
from
their
acquirements
arose,
as
shall
be
hereafter
demonstrated,
from
their
general
ignorance,
which
rendered
them
unable
to
investigate
or
apprehend
even
the
first
principles
of
civil
and
commercial
philosophy.
And
what
other
than
the
total
eclipse
of
their
glory
could
be
expected
from
a
nobility,
rude
and
unlettered
as
those
of
Portugal
are
described
by
the
author
of
the
Lusiad--a
court
and
nobility
who
sealed
the
truth
of
all
his
complaints
against
them
by
suffering
that
great
man,
the
light
of
their
age,
to
die
in
an
almshouse!
What
but
the
fall
of
their
state
could
be
expected
from
barbarians
like
these!
Nor
can
the
annals
of
mankind
produce
one
instance
of
the
fall
of
empire
where
the
character
of
the
nobles
was
other
than
that
ascribed
to
his
countrymen
by
Camoëns.
MICKLE'S
SKETCH
OF
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
DISCOVERY
OF
INDIA.
No
lesson
can
be
of
greater
national
importance
than
the
history
of
the
rise
and
the
fall
of
a
commercial
empire.
The
view
of
what
advantages
were
acquired,
and
of
what
might
have
been
still
added;
the
means
by
which
such
empire
might
have
been
continued,
and
the
errors
by
which
it
was
lost,
are
as
particularly
conspicuous
in
the
naval
and
commercial
history
of
Portugal
as
if
Providence
had
intended
to
give
a
lasting
example
to
mankind;
a
chart,
where
the
course
of
the
safe
voyage
is
pointed
out,
and
where
the
shelves
and
rocks,
and
the
seasons
of
tempest
are
discovered
and
foretold.
The
history
of
Portugal,
as
a
naval
and
commercial
power,
begins
with
the
designs
of
Prince
Henry.
But
as
the
enterprises
of
this
great
man,
and
the
completion
of
his
designs
are
intimately
connected
with
the
state
of
Portugal,
a
short
view
of
the
progress
of
the
power,
and
of
the
character
of
that
kingdom,
will
be
necessary
to
elucidate
the
history
of
the
revival
of
commerce,
and
the
subject
of
the
Lusiad.
During
the
centuries
when
the
effeminated
Roman
provinces
of
Europe
were
desolated
by
the
irruptions
of
the
northern
barbarians,
the
Saracens
spread
the
same
horrors
of
brutal
conquest
over
the
finest
countries
of
the
eastern
world.
The
northern
conquerors
of
the
finer
provinces
of
Europe
embraced
the
Christian
religion
as
professed
by
the
monks,
and,
contented
with
the
luxuries
of
their
new
settlements,
their
military
spirit
soon
declined.
The
Saracens,
on
the
other
hand,
having
embraced
the
religion
of
Mohammed,
their
rage
for
war
received
every
addition
which
can
possibly
be
inspired
by
religious
enthusiasm.
Not
only
the
spoils
of
the
vanquished,
but
Paradise
itself
was
to
be
obtained
by
their
sabres.
Strengthened
and
inspired
by
a
commission
which
they
esteemed
divine,
the
rapidity
of
their
conquests
far
exceeded
those
of
the
Goths
and
Vandals.
The
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
every
country
they
subdued
embraced
their
religion
and
imbibed
their
principles;
thus,
the
professors
of
Mohammedanism
became
the
most
formidable
combination
ever
leagued
together
against
the
rest
of
mankind.
Morocco
and
the
adjacent
countries
had
now
received
the
doctrines
of
the
Koran,
and
the
arms
of
the
Saracens
spread
slaughter
and
desolation
from
the
south
of
Spain
to
Italy,
and
the
islands
of
the
Mediterranean.
All
the
rapine
and
carnage
committed
by
the
Gothic
conquerors
were
now
amply
returned
on
their
less
warlike
posterity.
In
Spain,
and
the
province
now
called
Portugal,
the
Mohammedans
erected
powerful
kingdoms,
and
their
lust
of
conquest
threatened
destruction
to
every
Christian
power.
But
a
romantic
military
spirit
revived
in
Europe
under
the
auspices
of
Charlemagne.
The
Mohammedans,
during
the
reign
of
this
sovereign,
made
a
most
formidable
irruption
into
Europe;
France
in
particular
felt
the
weight
of
their
fury.
By
the
invention
of
new
military
honours
that
monarch
drew
the
adventurous
youth
of
every
Christian
power
to
his
standards,
which
eventually
resulted
in
the
crusades,
the
beginning
of
which,
in
propriety,
should
be
dated
from
his
reign.
Few
indeed
are
the
historians
of
this
period,
but
enough
remains
to
prove,
that
though
the
writers
of
the
old
romance
seized
upon
it,
and
added
the
inexhaustible
machinery
of
magic
to
the
adventures
of
their
heroes,
yet
the
origin
of
their
fictions
was
founded
on
historical
facts.[34]
Yet,
however
this
period
may
thus
resemble
the
fabulous
ages
of
Greece,
certain
it
is,
that
an
Orlando,
a
Rinaldo,
a
Rugero,
and
other
celebrated
names
in
romance,
acquired
great
honour
in
the
wars
which
were
waged
against
the
Saracens,
the
invaders
of
Europe.
In
these
romantic
wars,
by
which
the
power
of
the
Mohammedans
was
checked,
several
centuries
elapsed,
when
Alonzo,
King
of
Castile,
apprehensive
that
the
whole
force
of
the
Mohammedans
of
Spain
and
Morocco
was
ready
to
fall
upon
him,
prudently
imitated
the
conduct
of
Charlemagne.
He
availed
himself
of
the
spirit
of
chivalry,
and
demanded
leave
of
Philip
I.
of
France,
and
other
princes,
that
volunteers
from
their
dominions
might
be
allowed
to
distinguish
themselves,
under
his
banners,
against
the
Saracens.
His
desire
was
no
sooner
known
than
a
brave
army
of
volunteers
thronged
to
his
standard,
and
Alonzo
was
victorious.
Honours
and
endowments
were
liberally
distributed
among
the
champions;
and
to
Henry,
a
younger
son
of
the
Duke
of
Burgundy,
he
gave
his
daughter,
Teresa,
in
marriage,
with
the
sovereignty
of
the
countries
south
of
Galicia
as
a
dowry,
commissioning
him
to
extend
his
dominions
by
the
expulsion
of
the
Moors.
Henry,
who
reigned
by
the
title
of
Count,
improved
every
advantage
which
offered.
The
two
rich
provinces
of
Entro
Minho
e
Douro,
and
Tras
os
Montes,
yielded
to
his
arms;
great
part
of
Beira
also
was
subdued,
and
the
Moorish
King
of
Lamego
became
his
tributary.
Many
thousands
of
Christians,
who
had
lived
in
miserable
subjection
to
the
Moors,
took
shelter
under
the
generous
protection
of
Count
Henry.
Great
numbers
of
the
Moors
also
changed
their
religion,
and
chose
rather
to
continue
in
the
land
where
they
were
born
than
be
exposed
to
the
severities
and
injustice
of
their
native
governors.
And
thus,
one
of
the
most
beautiful[35]
and
fertile
spots
of
the
world,
with
the
finest
climate,
in
consequence
of
a
crusade[36]
against
the
Mohammedans,
became
in
the
end
the
kingdom
of
Portugal,
a
sovereignty
which
in
course
of
time
spread
its
influence
far
over
the
world.
Count
Henry,
after
a
successful
reign,
was
succeeded
by
his
infant
son,
Don
Alonzo-Henry,
who,
having
surmounted
the
dangers
which
threatened
his
youth,
became
the
founder
of
the
Portuguese
monarchy.
In
1139
the
Moors
of
Spain
and
Barbary
united
their
forces
to
recover
the
dominions
from
which
they
had
been
driven
by
the
Christians.
According
to
the
accounts
of
the
Portuguese
writers,
the
Moorish
army
amounted
to
near
400,000
men;
nor
is
this
number
incredible
when
we
consider
what
armies
they
at
other
times
have
brought
into
the
field,
and
that
at
this
time
they
came
to
take
possession
of
lands
from
which
they
had
been
expelled.
Don
Alonzo,
however,
with
a
very
small
army,
gave
them
battle
on
the
plains
of
Ourique,
and
after
a
struggle
of
six
hours,
obtained
a
most
glorious
and
complete
victory,
and
one
which
was
crowned
with
an
event
of
the
utmost
importance.
On
the
field
of
battle
Don
Alonzo
was
proclaimed
King
of
Portugal
by
his
victorious
soldiers,
and
he
in
return
conferred
the
rank
of
nobility
on
the
whole
army.
The
constitution
of
the
monarchy,
however,
was
not
settled,
nor
was
Alonzo
invested
with
the
regalia
till
six
years
after
this
memorable
victory.
The
kind
of
government
the
Portuguese
had
submitted
to
under
the
Spaniards
and
Moors,
and
the
advantages
which
they
saw
were
derived
from
their
own
valour,
had
taught
them
the
love
of
liberty,
while
Alonzo
himself
understood
the
spirit
of
his
subjects
too
well
to
make
the
least
attempt
to
set
himself
up
as
a
despotic
monarch.
After
six
years
spent
in
further
victories,
he
called
an
assembly
of
the
prelates,
nobility,
and
commons,
to
meet
at
Lamego.
When
the
assembly
opened,
Alonzo
appeared
seated
on
the
throne,
but
without
any
other
mark
of
regal
dignity.
Before
he
was
crowned,
the
constitution
of
the
state
was
settled,
and
eighteen
statutes
were
solemnly
confirmed
by
oath[37]
as
the
charter
of
king
and
people;
statutes
diametrically
opposite
to
the
divine
right
and
arbitrary
power
of
kings,
principles
which
inculcate
and
demand
the
unlimited
passive
obedience
of
the
subject.
The
founders
of
the
Portuguese
monarchy
transmitted
to
their
heirs
those
generous
principles
of
liberty
which
complete
and
adorn
the
martial
character.
The
ardour
of
the
volunteer,
an
ardour
unknown
to
the
slave
and
the
mercenary,
added
to
the
most
romantic
ideas
of
military
glory,
characterized
the
Portuguese
under
the
reigns
of
their
first
monarchs.
Engaged
in
almost
continual
war
with
the
Moors,
this
spirit
rose
higher
and
higher;
and
the
desire
to
extirpate
Mohammedanism--the
principle
which
animated
the
wish
of
victory
in
every
battle--seemed
to
take
deeper
root
in
every
age.
Such
were
the
manners,
and
such
the
principles
of
the
people
who
were
governed
by
the
successors
of
Alonzo
I.--a
succession
of
great
men
who
proved
themselves
worthy
to
reign
over
so
military
and
enterprising
a
nation.
By
a
continued
train
of
victories
the
Portuguese
had
the
honour
to
drive
the
Moors
from
Europe.
The
invasions
of
European
soil
by
these
people
were
now
requited
by
successful
expeditions
into
Africa.
Such
was
the
manly
spirit
of
these
ages,
that
the
statutes
of
Lamego
received
additional
articles
in
favour
of
liberty,
a
convincing
proof
that
the
general
heroism
of
a
people
depends
upon
the
principles
of
freedom.
Alonzo
IV.,[38]
though
not
an
amiable
character,
was
perhaps
the
greatest
warrior,
politician,
and
monarch
of
his
age.
After
a
reign
of
military
splendour,
he
left
his
throne
to
his
son
Pedro,
surnamed
the
Just.
Ideas
of
equity
and
literature
were
now
diffused
by
this
great
prince,[39]
who
was
himself
a
polite
scholar,
and
a
most
accomplished
gentleman.
Portugal
began
to
perceive
the
advantages
of
cultivated
talents,
and
to
feel
its
superiority
over
the
barbarous
politics
of
the
ignorant
Moors.
The
great
Pedro,
however,
was
succeeded
by
a
weak
prince,
and
the
heroic
spirit
of
the
Portuguese
seemed
to
exist
no
more
under
his
son
Fernando,
surnamed
the
Careless.
Under
John
I.[40]
all
the
virtues
of
the
Portuguese
again
shone
forth
with
redoubled
lustre.
Happily
for
Portugal,
his
father
had
bestowed
an
excellent
education
upon
this
prince,
which,
added
to
his
great
natural
talents,
rendered
him
one
of
the
greatest
of
monarchs.
Conscious
of
the
superiority
which
his
own
liberal
education
gave
him,
he
was
assiduous
to
bestow
the
same
advantages
upon
his
children,
and
he
himself
often
became
their
preceptor
in
science
and
useful
knowledge.
Fortunate
in
all
his
affairs,
he
was
most
of
all
fortunate
in
his
family.
He
had
many
sons,
and
he
lived
to
see
them
become
men
of
parts
and
of
action,
whose
only
emulation
was
to
show
affection
to
his
person
and
to
support
his
administration
by
their
great
abilities.
All
the
sons
of
John
excelled
in
military
exercises,
and
in
the
literature
of
their
age;
Don
Edward
and
Don
Pedro[41]
were
particularly
educated
for
the
cabinet,
and
the
mathematical
genius
of
Don
Henry
received
every
encouragement
which
a
king
and
a
father
could
give
to
ripen
it
into
perfection
and
public
utility.
History
was
well
known
to
Prince
Henry,
and
his
turn
of
mind
peculiarly
enabled
him
to
make
political
observations
upon
it.
The
history
of
ancient
Tyre
and
Carthage
showed
him
what
a
maritime
nation
might
hope
to
become;
and
the
flourishing
colonies
of
the
Greeks
were
the
frequent
topic
of
his
conversation.
Where
Grecian
commerce
extended
its
influence
the
deserts
became
cultivated
fields,
cities
rose,
and
men
were
drawn
from
the
woods
and
caverns
to
unite
in
society.
The
Romans,
on
the
other
hand,
when
they
destroyed
Carthage,
buried
in
her
ruins
the
fountain
of
civilization,
improvement
and
opulence.
They
extinguished
the
spirit
of
commerce,
and
the
agriculture
of
the
conquered
nations.
And
thus,
while
the
luxury
of
Rome
consumed
the
wealth
of
her
provinces,
her
uncommercial
policy
dried
up
the
sources
of
its
continuance.
Nor
were
the
inestimable
advantages
of
commerce
the
sole
motives
of
Henry.
All
the
ardour
that
the
love
of
his
country
could
awaken
conspired
to
stimulate
the
natural
turn
of
his
genius
for
the
improvement
of
navigation.
As
the
kingdom
of
Portugal
had
been
wrested
from
the
Moors,
and
established
by
conquest,
so
its
existence
still
depended
on
the
superiority
of
force
of
arms;
and
even
before
the
birth
of
Henry,
the
superiority
of
the
Portuguese
navies
had
been
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
the
protection
of
the
state.
Whatever,
therefore,
might
curb
the
power
of
the
Moors,
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
existence
of
Portugal.
Such
were
the
views
and
circumstances
which
united
to
inspire
the
designs
of
Henry,
designs
which
were
powerfully
enforced
by
the
religion
of
that
prince.
Desire
to
extirpate
Mohammedanism
was
synonymous
with
patriotism
in
Portugal.
It
was
the
principle
which
gave
birth
to,
and
supported
their
monarchy.
Their
kings
avowed
it;
and
Prince
Henry
always
professed,
that
to
propagate
the
Gospel
and
extirpate
Mohammedanism,
was
the
great
purpose
of
all
his
enterprises.
The
same
principles,
it
is
certain,
inspired
King
Emmanuel,
under
whom
the
eastern
world
was
discovered
by
Gama.[42]
The
crusades,
which
had
rendered
the
greatest
political
service
to
Spain
and
Portugal,
had
begun
now
to
have
some
effect
upon
the
commerce
of
Europe.
The
Hanse
Towns
had
received
charters
of
liberty,
and
had
united
together
for
the
protection
of
their
trade
against
the
pirates
of
the
Baltic.
The
Lombards
had
opened
a
lucrative
traffic
with
the
ports
of
Egypt,
from
whence
they
imported
into
Europe
the
riches
of
India;
and
Bruges,
the
mart
between
them
and
the
Hanse
Towns,
was,
in
consequence,
surrounded
with
the
best
agriculture
of
these
ages,[43]
a
certain
proof
of
the
dependence
of
agriculture
upon
the
extent
of
commerce.
The
Hanse
Towns
were
liable,
however,
to
be
buried
in
the
victories
of
a
tyrant,
and
the
trade
with
Egypt
was
exceedingly
insecure
and
precarious.
Europe
was
still
enveloped
in
the
dark
mists
of
ignorance;
commerce
still
crept,
in
an
infant
state,
along
the
coasts,
nor
were
the
ships
adapted
for
long
voyages.
A
successful
tyrant
might
have
overwhelmed
the
system
of
commerce
entirely,
for
it
stood
on
a
much
narrower
basis
than
in
the
days
of
Phœnician
and
Greek
colonization.
A
broader
and
more
permanent
foundation
of
commerce
than
the
world
had
yet
seen
was
wanting
to
bless
mankind,
and
Henry,
Duke
of
Viseo,
was
born
to
give
it.
In
order
to
promote
his
designs,
Prince
Henry
was
appointed
Commander-in-chief
of
the
Portuguese
forces
in
Africa.
He
had
already,
in
1412,
three
years
before
the
reduction
of
Ceuta,[44]
sent
a
ship
to
make
discoveries
on
the
Barbary
coast.
Cape
Nam[45]
(as
its
name
implies)
was
then
the
_ne
plus
ultra_
of
European
navigation;
the
ship
sent
by
Henry,
however,
passed
it
sixty
leagues,
and
reached
Cape
Bojador.
About
a
league
and
a
half
from
Cape
St.
Vincent
(supposed
to
be
the
Promontorium
Sacrum
of
the
Romans),
Prince
Henry
built
his
town
of
Sagrez,
the
best
planned
and
fortified
town
in
Portugal.
Here,
where
the
view
of
the
ocean
inspired
his
hopes,
he
erected
his
arsenals,
and
built
and
harboured
his
ships.
And
here,
leaving
the
temporary
bustle
and
cares
of
the
State
to
his
father
and
brothers,
he
retired
like
a
philosopher
from
the
world
in
order
to
promote
its
happiness.
Having
received
all
the
information
he
could
obtain
in
Africa,
he
continued
unwearied
in
his
mathematical
and
geographical
studies;
the
art
of
ship-building
received
amazing
improvement
under
his
direction,
and
the
correctness
of
his
ideas
of
the
structure
of
the
globe
is
now
confirmed.
He
it
was
who
first
suggested
the
use
of
the
mariner's
compass,
and
of
longitude
and
latitude
in
navigation,
and
demonstrated
how
these
might
be
ascertained
by
astronomical
observations.
Naval
adventurers
were
now
invited
from
all
parts
to
the
town
of
Sagrez,
and
in
1418
Juan
Gonsalez
Zarco
and
Tristran
Vaz
set
sail
on
an
expedition
of
discovery,
the
circumstances
of
which
give
us
a
striking
picture
of
the
state
of
navigation
ere
it
was
remodelled
by
the
genius
of
Henry.
Cape
Bojador,
so
named
from
its
extent,[46]
runs
about
forty
leagues
to
the
westward,
and
for
about
six
leagues
off
land
there
is
a
most
violent
current,
which,
dashing
upon
the
shallows,
makes
a
tempestuous
sea.
This
was
deemed
impassable,
for
it
had
not
occurred
to
any
one
that
by
standing
out
to
sea
the
current
might
be
avoided.
To
pass
this
formidable
Cape
was
the
commission
of
Zarco
and
Vaz,
who
were
also
ordered
to
survey
the
African
coast,
which,
according
to
the
information
given
to
Henry
by
the
Moors,
extended
to
the
Equator.
Zarco
and
Vaz,
however,
lost
their
course
in
a
storm,
and
were
driven
to
a
small
island,
which,
in
the
joy
of
their
deliverance,
they
named
Puerto
Santo,
or
the
Holy
Haven.
Nor
was
Prince
Henry
less
joyful
of
their
discovery
than
they
had
been
of
their
escape:
sufficient
proof
of
the
miserable
state
of
navigation
in
those
days;
for
this
island
is
only
a
few
days'
voyage
from
Sagrez.
The
discoverers
of
Puerto
Santo,
accompanied
by
Bartholomew
Perestrello,
were,
with
three
ships,
sent
out
on
farther
trial.
Perestrello,
having
sown
some
seeds
and
left
some
cattle
at
Puerto
Santo,
returned
to
Portugal.[47]
Zarco
and
Vaz
directing
their
course
southward,
in
1419,
perceived
something
like
a
cloud
on
the
water,
and
sailing
towards
it,
discovered
an
island
covered
with
woods,
which
from
this
circumstance
they
named
Madeira.[48]
And
this
rich
and
beautiful
island
was
the
first
reward
of
the
enterprises
of
Prince
Henry.
Nature
calls
upon
Portugal
to
be
a
maritime
power,
and
her
naval
superiority
over
the
Moors,
was,
in
the
time
of
Henry,
the
surest
defence
of
her
existence
as
a
kingdom.
Yet,
though
all
his
labours
tended
to
establish
that
naval
superiority
on
the
surest
basis,
though
even
the
religion
of
the
age
added
its
authority
to
the
clearest
political
principles
in
favour
of
Henry,
yet
were
his
enterprises
and
his
expected
discoveries
derided
with
all
the
insolence
of
ignorance,
and
the
bitterness
of
popular
clamour.
Barren
deserts
like
Lybia,
it
was
said,
were
all
that
could
be
found,
and
a
thousand
disadvantages,
drawn
from
these
data,
were
foreseen
and
foretold.
The
great
mind
and
better
knowledge
of
Henry,
however,
were
not
thus
to
be
shaken.
Twelve
years
had
elapsed
since
the
discovery
of
Madeira
in
unsuccessful
endeavours
to
carry
navigation
farther.
At
length,
one
of
his
captains,
named
Galianez,
in
1434
passed
the
Cape
of
Bojador,
till
then
invincible;
an
action,
says
Faria,
not
inferior
to
the
labours
of
Hercules.
Galianez,
the
next
year,
accompanied
by
Gonsalez
Baldaya,
carried
his
discoveries
many
leagues
farther.
Having
put
two
horsemen
on
shore
to
discover
the
face
of
the
country,
the
adventurers,
after
riding
several
hours,
saw
nineteen
men
armed
with
javelins.
The
natives
fled,
and
the
two
horsemen
pursued,
till
one
of
the
Portuguese,
being
wounded,
lost
the
first
blood
that
was
sacrificed
to
the
new
system
of
commerce.
A
small
beginning,
it
soon
swelled
into
oceans,
and
deluged
the
eastern
and
western
worlds.
The
cruelties
of
Hernando
Cortez,
and
that
more
horrid
barbarian,
Pizarro,[49]
are
no
more
to
be
charged
upon
Don
Henry
and
Columbus,
than
the
villainies
of
the
Jesuits
and
the
horrors
of
the
Inquisition
are
to
be
ascribed
to
Him
who
commands
us
to
do
to
our
neighbour
as
we
would
wish
our
neighbour
to
do
to
us.
But,
if
it
be
maintained
that
he
who
plans
a
discovery
ought
to
foresee
the
miseries
which
the
vicious
will
engraft
upon
his
enterprise,
let
the
objector
be
told
that
the
miseries
are
uncertain,
while
the
advantages
are
real
and
sure.
In
1440
Anthony
Gonsalez
brought
some
Moors
prisoners
to
Lisbon.
These
he
took
two
and
forty
leagues
beyond
Cape
Bojador,
and
in
1442
he
returned
with
his
captives.
One
Moor
escaped,
but
ten
blacks
of
Guinea
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
gold
dust
were
given
in
ransom
for
two
others.
A
rivulet
at
the
place
of
landing
was
named
by
Gonsalez,
Rio
del
Oro,
or
the
River
of
Gold.
And
the
islands
of
Adeget,
Arguim,
and
De
las
Garças
were
now
discovered.
The
negroes
of
Guinea,
the
first
ever
seen
in
Portugal,
and
the
gold
dust,
excited
other
passions
beside
admiration.
A
company
was
formed
at
Lagos,
under
the
auspices
of
Prince
Henry,
to
carry
on
a
traffic
with
the
newly
discovered
countries;
and,
as
the
Portuguese
considered
themselves
in
a
state
of
continual
hostility
with
the
Moors,
about
two
hundred
of
these
people,
inhabitants
of
the
Islands
of
Nar
and
Tider,
in
1444,
were
brought
prisoners
to
Portugal.
Next
year
Gonzalo
de
Cintra
was
attacked
by
the
Moors,
fourteen
leagues
beyond
Rio
del
Oro,
where,
with
seven
of
his
men,
he
was
killed.
This
hostile
proceeding
displeased
Prince
Henry,
and
in
1446
Anthony
Gonsalez
and
two
other
captains
were
sent
to
enter
into
a
treaty
of
peace
and
traffic
with
the
natives
of
Rio
del
Oro,
and
also
to
attempt
their
conversion.
But
these
proposals
were
rejected
by
the
barbarians,
one
of
whom,
however,
came
voluntarily
to
Portugal,
and
Juan
Fernandez
remained
with
the
natives,
to
observe
their
manners
and
the
products
of
the
country.
In
1447
upwards
of
thirty
ships
followed
the
route
of
traffic
which
was
now
opened;
and
John
de
Castilla
obtained
the
infamy
to
stand
the
first
on
the
list
of
those
names
whose
villainies
have
disgraced
the
spirit
of
commerce,
and
afforded
the
loudest
complaints
against
the
progress
of
navigation.
Dissatisfied
with
the
value
of
his
cargo,
he
seized
twenty
of
the
natives
of
Gomera
(one
of
the
Canaries),
who
had
assisted
him,
and
with
whom
he
was
in
friendly
alliance,
and
brought
them
as
slaves
to
Portugal.
But
Prince
Henry
resented
this
outrage,
and
having
given
them
some
valuable
presents
of
clothes,
restored
the
captives
to
freedom
and
their
native
country.
The
reduction
of
the
Canaries
was
also
this
year
attempted;
but
Spain
having
challenged
the
discovery
of
these
islands,
the
expedition
was
discontinued.
In
the
Canary
Islands
a
singular
feudal
custom
existed;
giving
to
the
chief
man,
or
governor,
a
temporary
right
to
the
person
of
every
bride
in
his
district.
In
1448
Fernando
Alonzo
was
sent
ambassador
to
the
king
of
Cape
Verde
with
a
treaty
of
trade
and
conversion,
which
was
defeated
at
that
time
by
the
treachery
of
the
natives.
In
1449
the
Azores
were
discovered
by
Gonsalo
Vello;
and
the
coast
sixty
leagues
beyond
Cape
Verde
was
visited
by
the
fleets
of
Henry.
It
is
also
certain
that
some
of
his
commanders
passed
the
equinoctial
line.
Prince
Henry
had
now,
with
inflexible
perseverance,
prosecuted
his
discoveries
for
upwards
of
forty
years.
His
father,
John
I.,
concurred
with
him
in
his
views,
and
gave
him
every
assistance;
his
brother,
King
Edward,
during
his
short
reign,
took
the
same
interest
in
his
expeditions
as
his
father
had
done;
nor
was
the
eleven
years'
regency
of
his
brother
Don
Pedro
less
auspicious
to
him.[50]
But
the
misunderstanding
between
Pedro
and
his
nephew
Alonzo
V.,
who
took
upon
him
the
reins
of
government
in
his
seventeenth
year,
retarded
the
designs
of
Henry,
and
gave
him
much
unhappiness.[51]
At
his
town
of
Sagrez,
from
whence
he
had
not
moved
for
many
years,
Don
Henry,
now
in
his
sixty-seventh
year,
yielded
to
the
stroke
of
fate,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
1463,
gratified
with
the
certain
prospect
that
the
route
to
the
eastern
world
would
one
day
crown
the
enterprises
to
which
he
had
given
birth.
He
saw
with
pleasure
the
naval
superiority
of
his
country
over
the
Moors
established
on
the
must
solid
basis,
its
trade
greatly
upon
the
increase,
and
flattered
himself
that
he
had
given
a
mortal
wound
to
Mohammedanism.
To
him,
as
to
their
primary
author,
are
due
all
the
inestimable
advantages
which
ever
have
flowed,
or
ever
will
flow
from
the
discovery
of
the
greatest
part
of
Africa,
and
of
the
East
and
West
Indies.
Every
improvement
in
the
state
and
manners
of
these
countries,
or
whatever
country
may
be
yet
discovered,
is
strictly
due
to
him.
What
is
an
Alexander,
crowned
with
trophies
at
the
head
of
his
army,
compared
with
a
Henry
contemplating
the
ocean
from
his
window
on
the
rock
of
Sagrez!
The
one
suggests
the
idea
of
a
destroying
demon,
the
other
of
a
benevolent
Deity.
From
1448,
when
Alonzo
V.
assumed
the
power
of
government,
till
the
end
of
his
reign
in
1471,
little
progress
was
made
in
maritime
affairs.
Cape
Catherine
alone
was
added
to
the
former
discoveries.
But
under
his
son,
John
II.,
the
designs
of
Prince
Henry
were
prosecuted
with
renewed
vigour.
In
1481
the
Portuguese
built
a
fort
on
the
Gold
Coast,
and
the
King
of
Portugal
took
the
title
of
Lord
of
Guinea.
Bartholomew
Diaz,
in
1486,
reached
the
river
which
he
named
_dell'Infante_
on
the
eastern
side
of
Africa,
but
deterred
by
the
storms
of
that
coast
from
proceeding
farther,
on
his
return
he
had
the
happiness
to
be
the
discoverer
of
the
promontory,
unknown
for
many
ages,
which
bounds
the
south
of
Africa.
From
the
storms
he
there
encountered
he
named
it
Cape
of
Storms;
but
John,
elated
with
the
promise
of
India,
which
this
discovery,
as
he
justly
deemed,
included,
gave
it
the
name
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope.
The
arts
and
valour
of
the
Portuguese
had
now
made
a
great
impression
on
the
minds
of
the
Africans.
The
King
of
Congo
sent
the
sons
of
some
of
his
principal
officers
to
Lisbon,
to
be
instructed
in
arts
and
religion;
and
ambassadors
from
the
King
of
Benin
requested
teachers
to
be
sent
to
his
kingdom.
On
the
return
of
his
subjects,
the
King
and
Queen
of
Congo,
with
100,000
of
their
people,
were
baptized.
An
ambassador
also
arrived
from
the
Christian
Emperor
of
Abyssinia,
and
Pedro
de
Covillam
and
Alonzo
de
Payva
were
sent
by
land
to
penetrate
into
the
East,
that
they
might
acquire
whatever
intelligence
might
facilitate
the
desired
navigation
to
India.
Covillam
and
Payva
parted
at
Toro
in
Arabia,
and
took
different
routes.
The
former
having
visited
Conanor,
Calicut,
and
Goa
in
India,
returned
to
Cairo,
where
he
heard
of
the
death
of
his
companion.
Here
also
he
met
the
Rabbi
Abraham
of
Beja,
who
was
employed
for
the
same
purpose
by
King
John.
Covillam
sent
the
Rabbi
home
with
an
account
of
what
countries
he
had
seen,
and
he
himself
proceeded
to
Ormuz
and
Ethiopia,
but,
as
Camoëns
expresses
it--
"To
_his_
native
shore,
Enrich'd
with
knowledge,
_he_
return'd
no
more."
Men,
whose
genius
led
them
to
maritime
affairs
began
now
to
be
possessed
by
an
ardent
ambition
to
distinguish
themselves;
and
the
famous
Columbus
offered
his
service
to
King
John,
and
was
rejected.
Every
one
knows
the
discoveries
of
this
great
adventurer,
but
his
history
is
generally
misunderstood.[52]
The
simple
truth
is,
Columbus,
who
acquired
his
skill
in
navigation
among
the
Portuguese,
could
be
no
stranger
to
the
design,
long
meditated
in
that
kingdom,
of
discovering
a
naval
route
to
India,
which,
according
to
ancient
geographers
and
the
opinion
of
that
age,
was
supposed
to
be
the
next
land
to
the
west
of
Spain.
And
that
India
and
the
adjacent
islands
were
the
regions
sought
by
Columbus
is
also
certain.
John,
who
esteemed
the
route
to
India
as
almost
discovered,
and
in
the
power
of
his
own
subjects,
rejected
the
proposals
of
the
foreigner.
But
Columbus
met
a
more
favourable
reception
from
Ferdinand
and
Isabella,
the
king
and
queen
of
Castile.
Columbus,
therefore,
proposed,
as
Magalhaens
afterwards
did,
for
the
same
reason,
to
steer
a
westward
course,
and
having
in
1492
discovered
some
western
islands,
in
1493,
on
his
return
to
Spain,
he
put
into
the
Tagus
with
great
tokens
of
the
riches
of
his
discovery.
Some
of
the
Portuguese
courtiers
(the
same
ungenerous
minds,
perhaps,
who
advised
the
rejection
of
Columbus
because
he
was
a
foreigner)
proposed
the
assassination
of
that
great
man,
thereby
to
conceal
from
Spain
the
advantages
of
his
navigation.
But
John,
though
Columbus
rather
roughly
upbraided
him,
looked
upon
him
now
with
a
generous
regret,
and
dismissed
him
with
honour.
The
King
of
Portugal,
however,
alarmed
lest
the
discoveries
of
Columbus
should
interfere
with
those
of
his
crown,
gave
orders
to
equip
a
war-fleet
to
protect
his
rights.
But
matters
were
adjusted
by
embassies,
and
that
celebrated
treaty
was
drawn
up
by
which
Spain
and
Portugal
divided
the
western
and
eastern
worlds
between
them.
The
eastern
half
of
the
world
was
allotted
for
the
Portuguese,
and
the
western
for
the
Spanish
navigation.
A
Papal
Bull
also,
which,
for
obvious
reasons,
prohibited
the
propagation
of
the
gospel
in
these
bounds
by
the
subjects
of
any
other
state,
confirmed
this
amicable
and
extraordinary
treaty.
Soon
after
this,
however,
while
the
thoughts
of
King
John
were
intent
on
the
discovery
of
India,
his
preparations
were
interrupted
by
his
death.
But
his
earnest
desires
and
great
designs
were
inherited,
together
with
his
crown,
by
his
cousin
Emmanuel;
and
in
1497
(the
year
before
Columbus
made
the
voyage
in
which
he
discovered
the
mouth
of
the
river
Oronoko),
Vasco
de
Gama
sailed
from
the
Tagus
for
the
discovery
of
India.
Of
this
voyage,
the
subject
of
the
Lusiad,
many
particulars
are
necessarily
mentioned
in
the
notes;
we
shall
therefore
only
allude
to
these,
but
be
more
explicit
on
the
others,
which
are
omitted
by
Camoëns
in
obedience
to
the
rules
of
epic
poetry.
Notwithstanding
the
popular
clamour
against
the
undertaking,
Emmanuel
was
determined
to
prosecute
the
views
of
Prince
Henry
and
John
II.
Three
sloops
of
war
and
a
store
ship,
manned
with
only
160
men,
were
fitted
out;
for
hostility
was
not
the
purpose
of
this
expedition.
Vasco
de
Gama,
a
gentleman
of
good
family,
who,
in
a
war
with
the
French,
had
given
signal
proofs
of
his
naval
skill,
was
commissioned
admiral
and
general,
and
his
brother
Paul,
with
his
friend
Nicholas
Coello,
were
appointed
to
command
under
him.
It
is
the
greatest
honour
of
kings
to
distinguish
the
characters
of
their
officers,
and
to
employ
them
accordingly.
Emmanuel
in
many
instances
was
happy
in
this
talent,
particularly
in
the
choice
of
his
admiral
for
the
discovery
of
India.
All
the
enthusiasm
of
desire
to
accomplish
his
end,
joined
with
the
greatest
heroism,
the
quickest
penetration,
and
coolest
prudence,
united
to
form
the
character
of
Gama.
On
his
appointment
he
confessed
to
the
king
that
his
mind
had
long
aspired
to
this
expedition.
The
king
expressed
great
confidence
in
his
prudence
and
honour,
and
gave
him,
with
his
own
hand,
the
colours
which
he
was
to
carry.
On
this
banner,
which
bore
the
cross
of
the
military
Order
of
Christ,
Gama,
with
great
enthusiasm,
took
the
oath
of
fidelity.
About
four
miles
from
Lisbon
is
a
chapel
on
the
sea
side.
To
this,
the
day
before
their
departure,
Gama
conducted
the
companions
of
his
expedition.
He
was
to
encounter
an
ocean
untried,
and
dreaded
as
unnavigable,
and
he
knew
the
power
of
religion
on
minds
which
are
not
inclined
to
dispute
its
authority.
The
whole
night
was
spent
in
the
chapel
in
prayers
for
success,
and
in
the
rites
of
their
devotion.
The
next
day,
when
the
adventurers
marched
to
the
fleet,
the
shore
of
Belem[53]
presented
one
of
the
most
solemn
and
affecting
scenes
perhaps
recorded
in
history.
The
beach
was
covered
with
the
inhabitants
of
Lisbon.
A
procession
of
priests,
in
their
robes,
sang
anthems
and
offered
up
invocations
to
heaven.
Every
one
looked
on
the
adventurers
as
brave
men
going
to
a
dreadful
execution;
as
rushing
upon
certain
death;
and
the
vast
multitude
caught
the
fire
of
devotion,
and
joined
aloud
in
prayers
for
their
success.
The
relations,
friends,
and
acquaintances
of
the
voyagers
wept;
all
were
affected;
the
sight
was
general;
Gama
himself
shed
manly
tears
on
parting
with
his
friends,
but
he
hurried
over
the
tender
scene,
and
hastened
on
board
with
all
the
alacrity
of
hope.
He
set
sail
immediately,
and
so
much
affected
were
the
thousands
who
beheld
his
departure,
that
they
remained
immovable
on
the
shore,
till
the
fleet,
under
full
sail,
vanished
from
their
sight.
It
was
on
the
8th
of
July
when
Gama
left
the
Tagus.
The
flag
ship
was
commanded
by
himself,
the
second
by
his
brother,
the
third
by
Coello,
and
the
store
ship
by
Gonsalo
Nunio.
Several
interpreters,
skilled
in
Arabic,
and
other
oriental
languages,
went
along
with
them.
Ten
malefactors
(men
of
abilities,
whose
sentences
of
death
were
reversed,
on
condition
of
their
obedience
to
Gama
in
whatever
embassies
or
dangers
among
the
barbarians
he
might
think
proper
to
employ
them),
were
also
on
board.
The
fleet,
favoured
by
the
weather,
passed
the
Canary
and
Cape
de
Verde
islands,
but
had
now
to
encounter
other
fortune.
Sometimes
stopped
by
dead
calms,
but
for
the
most
part
tossed
by
tempests,
which
increased
in
violence
as
they
proceeded
to
the
south.
Thus
driven
far
to
sea
they
laboured
through
that
wide
ocean
which
surrounds
St.
Helena,
in
seas,
says
Faria,
unknown
to
the
Portuguese
discoverers,
none
of
whom
had
sailed
so
far
to
the
west.
From
the
28th
of
July,
the
day
they
passed
the
isle
of
St.
James,
they
had
seen
no
shore,
and
now
on
November
the
4th
they
were
happily
relieved
by
the
sight
of
land.
The
fleet
anchored
in
the
large
bay,[54]
and
Coello
was
sent
in
search
of
a
river
where
they
might
take
in
wood
and
fresh
water.
Having
found
one,
the
fleet
made
towards
it,
and
Gama,
whose
orders
were
to
acquaint
himself
with
the
manners
of
the
people
wherever
he
touched,
ordered
a
party
of
his
men
to
bring
him
some
of
the
natives
by
force,
or
stratagem.
One
they
caught
as
he
was
gathering
honey
on
the
side
of
a
mountain,
and
brought
him
to
the
fleet.
He
expressed
the
greatest
indifference
about
the
gold
and
fine
clothes
which
they
showed
him,
but
was
greatly
delighted
with
some
glasses
and
little
brass
bells.
These
with
great
joy
he
accepted,
and
was
set
on
shore;
and
soon
after
many
of
the
blacks
came
for,
and
were
gratified
with,
the
like
trifles;
in
return
for
which
they
gave
plenty
of
their
best
provisions.
None
of
Gama's
interpreters,
however,
could
understand
a
word
of
their
language,
or
obtain
any
information
of
India.
The
friendly
intercourse
between
the
fleet
and
the
natives
was,
however,
soon
interrupted
by
the
imprudence
of
Veloso,
a
young
Portuguese,
which
occasioned
a
skirmish
wherein
Gama's
life
was
endangered.
Gama
and
some
others
were
on
shore
taking
the
altitude
of
the
sun,
when
in
consequence
of
Veloso's
rashness
they
were
attacked
by
the
blacks
with
great
fury.
Gama
defended
himself
with
an
oar,
and
received
a
dart
in
his
foot.
Several
others
were
likewise
wounded,
and
they
found
safety
in
retreat.
A
discharge
of
cannon
from
the
ships
facilitated
their
escape,
and
Gama,
esteeming
it
imprudent
to
waste
his
strength
in
attempts
entirely
foreign
to
the
design
of
his
voyage,
weighed
anchor,
and
steered
in
search
of
the
extremity
of
Africa.
In
this
part
of
the
voyage,
says
Osorius,
"The
heroism
of
Gama
was
greatly
displayed."
The
waves
swelled
up
like
mountains,
the
ships
seemed
at
one
time
heaved
up
to
the
clouds,
and
at
another
precipitated
to
the
bed
of
the
ocean.
The
winds
were
piercing
cold,
and
so
boisterous
that
the
pilot's
voice
could
seldom
be
heard,
and
a
dismal
darkness,
which
at
that
tempestuous
season
involves
these
seas,
added
all
its
horrors.
Sometimes
the
storm
drove
them
southward,
at
other
times
they
were
obliged
to
stand
on
the
tack
and
yield
to
its
fury,
preserving
what
they
had
gained
with
the
greatest
difficulty.
"With
such
mad
seas
the
daring
Gama
fought
For
many
a
day,
and
many
a
dreadful
night,
Incessant
labouring
round
the
stormy
Cape,
By
bold
ambition
led."
THOMSON.
During
any
interval
of
the
storm,
the
sailors,
wearied
out
with
fatigue,
and
abandoned
to
despair,
surrounded
Gama,
and
implored
him
not
to
suffer
himself,
and
those
committed
to
his
care,
to
perish
by
so
dreadful
a
death.
The
impossibility
that
men
so
weakened
could
endure
much
longer,
and
the
opinion
that
this
ocean
was
torn
by
eternal
tempest,
and
therefore
had
hitherto
been,
and
was
impassable,
were
urged.
But
Gama's
resolution
to
proceed
was
unalterable.[55]
A
conspiracy
was
then
formed
against
his
life.
But
his
brother
discovered
it,
and
the
courage
and
prudence
of
Gama
defeated
its
design.
He
put
the
chief
conspirators
and
all
the
pilots
in
irons,
and
he
himself,
his
brother,
Coello,
and
some
others,
stood
night
and
day
at
the
helm
and
directed
the
course.
At
last,
after
having
many
days,
with
unconquered
mind,
withstood
the
tempest
and
mutiny
(_molem
perfidiæ_)
the
storm
suddenly
ceased,
and
they
beheld
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope.
On
November
the
20th
all
the
fleet
doubled
that
promontory,
and
steering
northward,
coasted
along
a
rich
and
beautiful
shore,
adorned
with
large
forests
and
numberless
herds
of
cattle.
All
was
now
alacrity;
the
hope
that
they
had
surmounted
every
danger
revived
their
spirits,
and
the
admiral
was
beloved
and
admired.
Here,
and
at
the
bay,
which
they
named
St.
Blas,
they
took
in
provisions,
and
beheld
these
beautiful
rural
scenes,
described
by
Camoëns.
And
here
the
store
sloop
was
burnt
by
order
of
the
admiral.
On
December
the
8th
a
violent
tempest
drove
the
fleet
out
of
sight
of
land,
and
carried
them
to
that
dreadful
current
which
made
the
Moors
deem
it
impossible
to
double
the
Cape.
Gama,
however,
though
unlucky
in
the
time
of
navigating
these
seas,
was
safely
carried
over
the
current
by
the
violence
of
a
tempest;
and
having
recovered
the
sight
of
land,
as
his
safest
course
he
steered
northward
along
the
coast.
On
the
10th
of
January
they
discovered,
about
230
miles
from
their
last
watering
place,
some
beautiful
islands,
with
herds
of
cattle
frisking
in
the
meadows.
It
was
a
profound
calm,
and
Gama
stood
near
to
land.
The
natives
were
better
dressed
and
more
civilized
than
those
they
had
hitherto
seen.
An
exchange
of
presents
was
made,
and
the
black
king
was
so
pleased
with
the
politeness
of
Gama,
that
he
came
aboard
his
ship
to
see
him.
At
this
place,
which
he
named
Terra
de
Natal,
Gama
left
two
of
the
malefactors
before
mentioned
to
procure
what
information
they
could
against
his
return.
On
the
15th
of
January,
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening,
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
large
river,
whose
banks
were
shaded
with
trees
laden
with
fruit.
On
the
return
of
day
they
saw
several
little
boats
with
palm-tree
leaves
making
towards
them,
and
the
natives
came
aboard
without
hesitation
or
fear.
Gama
received
them
kindly,
gave
them
an
entertainment,
and
some
silken
garments,
which
they
received
with
visible
joy.
Only
one
of
them,
however,
could
speak
a
little
broken
Arabic.
From
him
Fernan
Martinho
learned
that
not
far
distant
was
a
country
where
ships,
in
shape
and
size
like
Gama's,
frequently
resorted.
This
gave
the
fleet
great
encouragement,
and
the
admiral
named
this
place
"The
River
of
Good
Signs."
Here,
while
Gama
refitted
his
ships,
the
crews
were
attacked
with
a
violent
scurvy,
which
carried
off
several
of
his
men.
Having
taken
in
fresh
provisions,
on
the
24th
of
February
he
set
sail,
and
on
the
1st
of
March
they
descried
four
islands
on
the
coast
of
Mozambique.
From
one
of
these
they
perceived
seven
vessels
in
full
sail
bearing
to
the
fleet.
The
Râis,
or
captain,
knew
Gama's
ship
by
the
admiral's
ensign,
and
made
up
to
her,
saluting
her
with
loud
huzzas
and
instruments
of
music.
Gama
received
them
aboard,
and
entertained
them
with
great
kindness.
The
interpreters
talked
with
them
in
Arabic.
The
island,
in
which
was
the
principal
harbour
and
trading
town,
they
said,
was
governed
by
a
deputy
of
the
King
of
Quiloa;
and
many
Arab
merchants,
they
added,
were
settled
here,
who
traded
with
Arabia,
India,
and
other
parts
of
the
world.
Gama
was
overjoyed,
and
the
crew,
with
uplifted
hands,
returned
thanks
to
Heaven.
Pleased
with
the
presents
which
Gama
sent
him,
and
imagining
that
the
Portuguese
were
Mohammedans
from
Morocco,
the
governor,
dressed
in
rich
embroidery,
came
to
congratulate
the
admiral
on
his
arrival
in
the
east.
As
he
approached
the
fleet
in
great
pomp,
Gama
removed
the
sick
out
of
sight,
and
ordered
all
those
in
health
to
attend
above
deck,
armed
in
the
Portuguese
manner;
for
he
foresaw
what
would
happen
when
the
Mohammedans
should
discover
it
was
a
Christian
fleet.
During
the
entertainment
provided
for
him
Zacocia
seemed
highly
pleased,
and
asked
several
questions
about
the
arms
and
religion
of
the
strangers.
Gama
showed
him
his
arms,
and
explained
the
force
of
his
cannon,
but
he
did
not
affect
to
know
much
about
religion;
however
he
frankly
promised
to
show
him
his
books
of
devotion
whenever
a
few
days
refreshment
should
give
him
a
more
convenient
time.
In
the
meanwhile
he
entreated
Zacocia
to
send
him
some
pilots
who
might
conduct
him
to
India.
Two
pilots
were
next
day
brought
by
the
governor,
a
treaty
of
peace
was
solemnly
concluded,
and
every
office
of
mutual
friendship
seemed
to
promise
a
lasting
harmony.
But
it
was
soon
interrupted.
Zacocia,
as
soon
as
he
found
the
Portuguese
were
Christians,
used
every
endeavour
to
destroy
the
fleet.
The
life
of
Gama
was
attempted.
One
of
the
Moorish
pilots
deserted,
and
some
of
the
Portuguese
who
were
on
shore
to
get
fresh
water
were
attacked
by
the
natives,
but
were
rescued
by
a
timely
assistance
from
the
ships.
Besides
the
hatred
of
the
Christian
name,
inspired
by
their
religion,
the
Arabs
had
other
reasons
to
wish
the
destruction
of
Gama.
Before
this
period,
they
were
almost
the
only
merchants
of
the
East;
they
had
colonies
in
every
place
convenient
for
trade,
and
were
the
sole
masters
of
the
Ethiopian,
Arabian,
and
Indian
seas.
They
clearly
foresaw
the
consequences
of
the
arrival
of
Europeans,
and
every
art
was
soon
exerted
to
prevent
such
formidable
rivals
from
effecting
any
footing
in
the
East.
To
these
Mohammedan
traders
the
Portuguese
gave
the
name
of
Moors.
Immediately
after
the
skirmish
at
the
watering-place,
Gama,
having
one
Moorish
pilot,
set
sail,
but
was
soon
driven
back
by
tempestuous
weather.
He
now
resolved
to
take
in
fresh
water
by
force.
The
Moors
perceiving
his
intention,
about
two
thousand
of
them
rising
from
ambush,
attacked
the
Portuguese
detachment.
But
the
prudence
of
Gama
had
not
been
asleep.
His
ships
were
stationed
with
art,
and
his
artillery
not
only
dispersed
the
hostile
Moors,
but
reduced
their
town,
which
was
built
of
wood,
into
a
heap
of
ashes.
Among
some
prisoners
taken
by
Paulus
de
Gama
was
a
pilot,
and
Zacocia
begging
forgiveness
for
his
treachery,
sent
another,
whose
skill
in
navigation
he
greatly
commended.
A
war
with
the
Moors
was
now
begun.
Gama
perceived
that
their
jealousy
of
European
rivals
gave
him
nothing
to
expect
but
open
hostility
and
secret
treachery;
and
he
knew
what
numerous
colonies
they
had
on
every
trading
coast
of
the
East.
To
impress
them,
therefore,
with
the
terror
of
his
arms
on
their
first
act
of
treachery,
was
worthy
of
a
great
commander.
Nor
was
he
remiss
in
his
attention
to
the
chief
pilot
who
had
been
last
sent.
He
perceived
in
him
a
kind
of
anxious
endeavour
to
bear
near
some
little
islands,
and
suspecting
there
were
unseen
rocks
in
that
course,
he
confidently
charged
the
pilot
with
guilt,
and
ordered
him
to
be
severely
whipped.
The
punishment
produced
a
confession
and
promises
of
fidelity.
And
he
now
advised
Gama
to
stand
for
Quiloa,
which
he
assured
him
was
inhabited
by
Christians.
Three
Ethiopian
Christians
had
come
aboard
the
fleet
while
at
Zacocia's
island,
and
the
opinions
then
current
about
Prester
John's
country
inclined
Gama
to
try
if
he
could
find
a
port
where
he
might
obtain
the
assistance
of
a
people
of
his
own
religion.
A
violent
storm,
however,
drove
the
fleet
from
Quiloa,
and
being
now
near
Mombas,
the
pilot
advised
him
to
enter
that
harbour,
where,
he
said,
there
were
also
many
Christians.
The
city
of
Mombas
is
agreeably
situated
on
an
island,
formed
by
a
river
which
empties
itself
into
the
sea
by
two
mouths.
The
buildings
are
lofty
and
of
solid
stone,
and
the
country
abounds
with
fruit-trees
and
cattle.
Gama,
happy
to
find
a
harbour
where
everything
wore
the
appearance
of
civilization,
ordered
the
fleet
to
cast
anchor,
which
was
scarcely
done,
when
a
galley,
in
which
were
100
men
in
oriental
costume,
armed
with
bucklers
and
sabres,
rowed
up
to
the
flag
ship.
All
of
these
seemed
desirous
to
come
on
board,
but
only
four,
who
by
their
dress
seemed
officers,
were
admitted;
nor
were
these
allowed,
till
stripped
of
their
arms.
When
on
board
they
extolled
the
prudence
of
Gama
in
refusing
admittance
to
armed
strangers;
and
by
their
behaviour,
seemed
desirous
to
gain
the
good
opinion
of
the
fleet.
Their
country,
they
boasted,
contained
all
the
riches
of
India;
and
their
king,
they
professed,
was
ambitious
of
entering
into
a
friendly
treaty
with
the
Portuguese,
with
whose
renown
he
was
well
acquainted.
And,
that
a
conference
with
his
majesty
and
the
offices
of
friendship
might
be
rendered
more
convenient,
Gama
was
requested
to
enter
the
harbour.
As
no
place
could
be
more
commodious
for
the
recovery
of
the
sick,
Gama
resolved
to
enter
the
port;
and
in
the
meanwhile
sent
two
of
the
pardoned
criminals
as
an
embassy
to
the
king.
These
the
king
treated
with
the
greatest
kindness,
ordered
his
officers
to
show
them
the
strength
and
opulence
of
his
city;
and,
on
their
return
to
the
navy,
he
sent
a
present
to
Gama
of
the
most
valuable
spices,
of
which
he
boasted
such
abundance,
that
the
Portuguese,
he
said,
if
they
regarded
their
own
interest,
would
seek
for
no
other
India.
To
make
treaties
of
commerce
was
the
business
of
Gama;
and
one
so
advantageous
was
not
to
be
refused.
Fully
satisfied
by
the
report
of
his
spies,
he
ordered
to
weigh
anchor
and
enter
the
harbour.
His
own
ship
led
the
way,
when
a
sudden
violence
of
the
tide
made
Gama
apprehensive
of
running
aground.
He
therefore
ordered
the
sails
to
be
furled,
and
the
anchors
to
be
dropped,
and
gave
a
signal
for
the
rest
of
the
fleet
to
follow
his
example.
This
manœuvre,
and
the
cries
of
the
sailors
in
executing
it,
alarmed
the
Mozambique
pilots.
Conscious
of
their
treachery,
they
thought
their
design
was
discovered,
and
leaped
into
the
sea.
Some
boats
of
Mombas
took
them
up,
and
refusing
to
put
them
on
board,
set
them
safely
on
shore,
though
the
admiral
repeatedly
demanded
the
restoration
of
the
pilots.
These
proofs
of
treachery
were
farther
confirmed
by
the
behaviour
of
the
King
of
Mombas.
In
the
middle
of
the
night
Gama
thought
he
heard
some
noise,
and
on
examination,
found
his
fleet
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
Moors,
who,
with
the
utmost
secrecy,
endeavoured
to
cut
his
cables.
But
their
scheme
was
defeated;
and
some
Arabs,
who
remained
on
board,
confessed
that
no
Christians
were
resident
either
at
Quiloa
or
Mombas.
The
storm
which
drove
them
from
the
one
place,
and
their
late
escape
at
the
other,
were
now
beheld
as
manifestations
of
the
Divine
favour,
and
Gama,
holding
up
his
hands
to
heaven,
ascribed
his
safety
to
the
care
of
Providence.[56]
Two
days,
however,
elapsed
before
they
could
get
clear
of
the
rocky
bay
of
Mombas.
Having
now
ventured
to
hoist
their
sails,
they
steered
for
Melinda,
a
port,
they
had
been
told,
where
many
merchants
from
India
resorted.
In
their
way
thither
they
took
a
Moorish
vessel,
out
of
which
Gama
selected
fourteen
prisoners,
one
of
whom
he
perceived
by
his
mien
to
be
a
person
of
distinction.
By
this
Saracen,
Gama
was
informed
that
he
was
near
Melinda,
that
the
king
was
hospitable,
and
celebrated
for
his
faith,
and
that
four
ships
from
India,
commanded
by
Christian
masters,
were
in
that
harbour.
The
Saracen
also
offered
to
go
as
Gama's
messenger
to
the
king,
and
promised
to
procure
him
an
able
pilot
to
conduct
him
to
Calicut,
the
chief
port
of
India.
As
the
coast
of
Melinda
appeared
to
be
dangerous,
Gama
anchored
at
some
distance
from
the
city,
and,
unwilling
to
risk
the
safety
of
any
of
his
men,
he
landed
the
Saracen
on
an
island
opposite
to
Melinda.
This
was
observed,
and
the
stranger
was
brought
before
the
king,
to
whom
he
gave
so
favourable
an
account
of
the
politeness
and
humanity
of
Gama,
that
a
present
of
several
sheep,
and
fruits
of
all
sorts,
was
sent
by
his
majesty
to
the
admiral,
who
had
the
happiness
to
find
the
truth
of
what
his
prisoner
had
told
him
confirmed
by
the
masters
of
the
four
ships
from
India.
These
were
Christians
from
Cambaya.
They
were
transported
with
joy
on
the
arrival
of
the
Portuguese,
and
gave
several
useful
instructions
to
the
admiral.
The
city
of
Melinda
was
situated
in
a
fertile
plain,
surrounded
with
gardens
and
groves
of
orange-trees,
whose
flowers
diffused
a
most
grateful
odour.
The
pastures
were
covered
with
herds;
and
the
houses,
built
of
square
stones,
were
both
elegant
and
magnificent.
Desirous
to
make
an
alliance
with
such
a
state,
Gama
requited
the
civility
of
the
king
with
great
generosity.
He
drew
nearer
the
shore,
and
urged
his
instructions
as
apology
for
not
landing
to
wait
upon
his
majesty
in
person.
The
apology
was
accepted,
and
the
king,
whose
age
and
infirmity
prevented
him
going
on
board,
sent
his
son
to
congratulate
Gama,
and
enter
into
a
treaty
of
friendship.
The
prince,
who
had
some
time
governed
under
the
direction
of
his
father,
came
in
great
pomp.
His
dress
was
royally
magnificent,
the
nobles
who
attended
him
displayed
all
the
riches
of
silk
and
embroidery,
and
the
music
of
Melinda
resounded
all
over
the
bay.
Gama,
to
express
his
regard,
met
him
in
the
admiral's
barge.
The
prince,
as
soon
as
he
came
up,
leaped
into
it,
and
distinguishing
the
admiral
by
his
habit,
embraced
him
with
all
the
intimacy
of
old
friendship.
In
their
conversation,
which
was
long
and
sprightly,
he
discovered
nothing
of
the
barbarian,
says
Osorius,
but
in
everything
showed
an
intelligence
and
politeness
worthy
of
his
high
rank.
He
accepted
the
fourteen
Moors,
whom
Gama
gave
to
him,
with
great
pleasure.
He
seemed
to
view
Gama
with
enthusiasm,
and
confessed
that
the
build
of
the
Portuguese
ships,
so
much
superior
to
what
he
had
seen,
convinced
him
of
the
greatness
of
that
people.
He
gave
Gama
an
able
pilot,
named
Melemo
Cana,
to
conduct
him
to
Calicut;
and
requested,
that
on
his
return
to
Europe,
he
would
carry
an
ambassador
with
him
to
the
court
of
Lisbon.
During
the
few
days
the
fleet
stayed
at
Melinda,
the
mutual
friendship
increased,
and
a
treaty
of
alliance
was
concluded.
And
now,
on
April
22,
resigning
the
helm
to
his
skilful
and
honest
pilot,
Gama
hoisted
sail
and
steered
to
the
north.
In
a
few
days
they
passed
the
line,
and
the
Portuguese
with
ecstasy
beheld
the
appearance
of
their
native
sky.
Orion,
Ursa
Major
and
Minor,
and
the
other
stars
about
the
north
pole,
were
now
a
more
joyful
discovery
than
the
south
pole
had
formerly
been
to
them.[57]
The
pilot
now
stood
out
to
the
east,
through
the
Indian
ocean;
and
after
sailing
about
three
weeks,
he
had
the
happiness
to
congratulate
Gama
on
the
view
of
the
mountains
of
Calicut,
who,
transported
with
ecstasy,
returned
thanks
to
Heaven,
and
ordered
all
his
prisoners
to
be
set
at
liberty.
About
two
leagues
from
Calicut,
Gama
ordered
the
fleet
to
anchor,
and
was
soon
surrounded
by
a
number
of
boats.
By
one
of
these
he
sent
one
of
the
pardoned
criminals
to
the
city.
The
appearance
of
an
unknown
fleet
on
their
coast
brought
immense
crowds
around
the
stranger,
who
no
sooner
entered
Calicut,
than
he
was
lifted
from
his
feet
and
carried
hither
and
thither
by
the
concourse.
Though
the
populace
and
the
stranger
were
alike
earnest
to
be
understood,
their
language
was
unintelligible
to
each
other,
till,
happily
for
Gama,
a
Moorish
merchant
accosted
his
messenger
in
the
Spanish
tongue.
The
next
day
this
Moor,
who
was
named
Monzaida,
waited
upon
Gama
on
board
his
ship.
He
was
a
native
of
Tunis,
and
the
chief
person,
he
said,
with
whom
John
II.
had
at
that
port
contracted
for
military
stores.
He
was
a
man
of
abilities
and
great
intelligence
of
the
world,
and
an
admirer
of
the
Portuguese
valour
and
honour.
The
engaging
behaviour
of
Gama
heightened
his
esteem
into
the
sincerest
attachment.
Monzaida
offered
to
be
interpreter
for
the
admiral,
and
to
serve
him
in
whatever
besides
he
might
possibly
befriend
him.
And
thus,
by
one
of
those
unforeseen
circumstances
which
often
decide
the
greatest
events,
Gama
obtained
a
friend
who
soon
rendered
him
the
most
important
services.
At
the
first
interview,
Monzaida
gave
Gama
the
fullest
information
of
the
climate,
extent,
customs,
religion,
and
riches
of
India,
the
commerce
of
the
Arabs,
and
the
character
of
the
sovereign.
Calicut
was
not
only
the
imperial
city,
but
the
greatest
port.
The
king,
or
zamorim,[58]
who
resided
here,
was
acknowledged
as
emperor
by
the
neighbouring
princes;
and,
as
his
revenue
consisted
chiefly
of
duties
on
merchandise,
he
had
always
encouraged
the
resort
of
foreigners
to
his
ports.
Pleased
with
this
promising
prospect,
Gama
sent
two
of
his
officers
with
Monzaida
to
wait
upon
the
zamorim
at
his
palace,
at
Pandarene,
a
few
miles
from
the
city.
They
were
admitted
to
the
royal
apartment,
and
delivered
their
embassy;
to
which
the
zamorim
replied,
that
the
arrival
of
the
admiral
of
so
great
a
prince
as
Emmanuel,
gave
him
inexpressible
pleasure,
and
that
he
would
willingly
embrace
the
offered
alliance.
In
the
meanwhile,
as
their
present
station
was
extremely
dangerous,
he
advised
them
to
bring
the
ships
nearer
to
Pandarene,
and
for
this
purpose
he
sent
a
pilot
to
the
fleet.
A
few
days
after
this,
the
zamorim
sent
his
first
minister,
or
catual,[59]
attended
by
several
of
the
nayres,
or
nobility,
to
conduct
Gama
to
the
royal
palace.
As
an
interview
with
the
zamorim
was
absolutely
necessary
to
complete
the
purpose
of
his
voyage,
Gama
immediately
agreed
to
it,
though
the
treachery
he
had
already
experienced
since
his
arrival
in
the
eastern
seas
showed
him
the
personal
danger
which
he
thus
hazarded.
He
gave
his
brother,
Paulus,
and
Coello
the
command
of
the
fleet
in
his
absence.
The
revenue
of
the
zamorim
arose
chiefly
from
the
traffic
of
the
Moors;
the
various
colonies
of
these
people
were
combined
in
one
interest,
and
the
jealousy
and
consternation
which
his
arrival
in
the
eastern
seas
had
spread
among
them,
were
circumstances
well
known
to
Gama:
and
he
knew,
also,
what
he
had
to
expect,
both
from
their
force
and
their
fraud.
But
duty
and
honour
required
him
to
complete
the
purpose
of
his
voyage.
He
left
peremptory
command,
that
if
he
was
detained
a
prisoner,
or
any
attempt
made
upon
his
life,
they
should
take
no
step
to
save
him
or
to
reverse
his
fate;
to
give
ear
to
no
message
which
might
come
in
his
name
for
such
purpose,
and
to
enter
into
no
negotiation
on
his
behalf.
They
were
to
keep
some
boats
near
the
shore,
to
favour
his
escape
if
he
perceived
treachery
before
being
detained
by
force;
yet
the
moment
that
force
rendered
his
escape
impracticable
they
were
to
set
sail,
and
carry
the
tidings
to
the
king.
As
this
was
his
only
concern,
he
would
suffer
no
risk
that
might
lose
a
man,
or
endanger
the
homeward
voyage.
Having
left
these
orders,
he
went
ashore
with
the
catual,
attended
only
by
twelve
of
his
own
men,
for
he
would
not
weaken
his
fleet,
though
he
knew
the
pomp
of
attendance
would
in
one
respect
have
been
greatly
in
his
favour
at
the
first
court
of
India.
As
soon
as
landed,
he
and
the
catual
were
carried
in
great
pomp,
in
palanquins,
upon
men's
shoulders,
to
the
chief
temple,
and
thence,
amid
immense
crowds,
to
the
royal
palace.
The
apartment
and
dress
of
the
zamorim
were
such
as
might
be
expected
from
the
luxury
and
wealth
of
India.
The
emperor
reclined
on
a
magnificent
couch,
surrounded
with
his
nobility
and
officers
of
state.
Gama
was
introduced
to
him
by
a
venerable
old
man,
the
chief
brahmin.
His
majesty,
by
a
gentle
nod,
appointed
the
admiral
to
sit
on
one
of
the
steps
of
his
sofa,
and
then
demanded
his
embassy.
It
was
against
the
custom
of
his
country,
Gama
replied,
to
deliver
his
instructions
in
a
public
assembly;
he
therefore
desired
that
the
king
and
a
few
of
his
ministers
would
grant
him
a
private
audience.
This
was
complied
with,
and
Gama,
in
a
manly
speech,
set
forth
the
greatness
of
his
sovereign
Emmanuel,
the
fame
he
had
heard
of
the
zamorim,
and
the
desire
he
had
to
enter
into
an
alliance
with
so
great
a
prince;
nor
were
the
mutual
advantages
of
such
a
treaty
omitted
by
the
admiral.
The
zamorim,
in
reply,
professed
great
esteem
for
the
friendship
of
the
King
of
Portugal,
and
declared
his
readiness
to
enter
into
a
friendly
alliance.
He
then
ordered
the
catual
to
provide
proper
apartments
for
Gama
in
his
own
house;
and
having
promised
another
conference,
he
dismissed
the
admiral
with
all
the
appearance
of
sincerity.
The
character
of
this
monarch
is
strongly
marked
in
the
history
of
Portuguese
Asia.
Avarice
was
his
ruling
passion;
he
was
haughty
or
mean,
bold
or
timorous,
as
his
interest
rose
or
fell
in
the
balance
of
his
judgment;
wavering
and
irresolute
whenever
the
scales
seemed
doubtful
which
to
preponderate.
He
was
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
bringing
the
commerce
of
Europe
to
his
harbours,
but
he
was
also
influenced
by
the
threats
of
the
Moors.
Three
days
elapsed
ere
Gama
was
again
permitted
to
see
the
zamorim.
At
this
second
audience
he
presented
the
letter
and
presents
of
Emmanuel.
The
letter
was
received
with
politeness,
but
the
presents
were
viewed
with
an
eye
of
contempt.
Gama
noticed
it,
and
said
he
only
came
to
discover
the
route
to
India,
and
therefore
was
not
charged
with
valuable
gifts,
before
the
friendship
of
the
state,
where
they
might
choose
to
traffic,
was
known.
Yet,
indeed,
he
brought
the
most
valuable
of
all
gifts,
the
offer
of
the
friendship
of
his
sovereign,
and
the
commerce
of
his
country.
He
then
entreated
the
king
not
to
reveal
the
contents
of
Emmanuel's
letter
to
the
Moors;
and
the
king,
with
great
apparent
friendship,
desired
Gama
to
guard
against
the
perfidy
of
that
people.
At
this
time,
it
is
highly
probable,
the
zamorim
was
sincere.
Every
hour
since
the
arrival
of
the
fleet
the
Moors
had
held
secret
conferences.
That
one
man
of
it
might
not
return
was
their
purpose;
and
every
method
to
accomplish
this
was
meditated.
To
influence
the
king
against
the
Portuguese,
to
assassinate
Gama,
to
raise
a
general
insurrection
to
destroy
the
foreign
navy,
and
to
bribe
the
catual,
were
determined.
And
the
catual
(the
master
of
the
house
where
Gama
was
lodged)
accepted
the
bribe,
and
entered
into
their
interest.
Of
all
these
circumstances,
however,
Gama
was
apprised
by
his
faithful
interpreter,
Monzaida,
whose
affection
to
the
foreign
admiral
the
Moors
hitherto
had
not
suspected.
Thus
informed,
and
having
obtained
the
faith
of
an
alliance
from
the
sovereign
of
the
first
port
of
India,
Gama
resolved
to
elude
the
plots
of
the
Moors;
and
accordingly,
before
the
dawn,
he
set
out
for
Pandarene,
in
hope
to
get
aboard
his
fleet
by
some
of
the
boats
which
he
had
ordered
to
hover
about
the
shore.
But
the
Moors
were
vigilant.
His
escape
was
immediately
known,
and
the
catual,
by
the
king's
order,
pursued
and
brought
him
back
by
force.
The
catual,
however
(for
it
was
necessary
for
their
schemes
to
have
the
ships
in
their
power),
behaved
with
politeness
to
the
admiral,
and
promised
to
use
all
his
interest
in
his
behalf.
The
eagerness
of
the
Moors
now
contributed
to
the
safety
of
Gama.
Their
principal
merchants
were
admitted
to
a
formal
audience,
when
one
of
their
orators
accused
the
Portuguese
as
a
nation
of
faithless
plunderers:
Gama,
he
said,
was
an
exiled
pirate,
who
had
marked
his
course
with
blood
and
depredation.
If
he
were
not
a
pirate,
still
there
was
no
excuse
for
giving
such
warlike
foreigners
any
footing
in
a
country
already
supplied
with
all
that
nature
and
commerce
could
give.
He
expatiated
on
the
great
services
which
the
Moorish
traders
had
rendered
to
Calicut;
and
ended
with
a
threat,
that
all
the
Moors
would
leave
the
zamorim's
ports
and
find
some
other
settlement,
if
he
permitted
these
foreigners
any
share
in
the
commerce
of
his
dominions.
However
staggered
with
these
arguments
and
threats,
the
zamorim
was
not
blind
to
the
self-interest
and
malice
of
the
Moors.
He
therefore
ordered,
that
the
admiral
should
once
more
be
brought
before
him.
In
the
meanwhile
the
catual
tried
many
stratagems
to
get
the
fleet
into
the
harbour;
and
at
last,
in
the
name
of
his
master,
made
an
absolute
demand
that
the
sails
and
rudders
should
be
delivered
up,
as
the
pledge
of
Gama's
honesty.
But
these
demands
were
as
absolutely
refused
by
Gama,
who
sent
a
letter
to
his
brother
by
Monzaida,
enforcing
his
former
orders
in
the
strongest
manner,
declaring
that
his
fate
gave
him
no
concern,
that
he
was
only
unhappy
lest
the
fruits
of
all
their
fatigue
and
dangers
should
be
lost.
After
two
days
spent
in
vain
altercation
with
the
catual,
Gama
was
brought
as
a
prisoner
before
the
king.
The
king
repeated
his
accusation;
upbraided
him
with
non-compliance
to
the
requests
of
his
minister;
urged
him,
if
he
were
an
exile
or
a
pirate,
to
confess
freely,
in
which
case
he
promised
to
take
him
into
his
service,
and
highly
promote
him
on
account
of
his
abilities.
But
Gama,
who
with
great
spirit
had
baffled
all
the
stratagems
of
the
catual,
behaved
with
the
same
undaunted
bravery
before
the
king.
He
asserted
his
innocence,
pointed
out
the
malice
of
the
Moors,
and
the
improbability
of
his
piracy;
boasted
of
the
safety
of
his
fleet,
offered
his
life
rather
than
his
sails
and
rudders,
and
concluded
with
threats
in
the
name
of
his
sovereign.
The
zamorim,
during
the
whole
conference,
eyed
Gama
with
the
keenest
attention,
and
clearly
perceived
in
his
unfaltering
mien
the
dignity
of
truth,
and
the
consciousness
that
he
was
the
admiral
of
a
great
monarch.
In
their
late
address,
the
Moors
had
treated
the
zamorim
as
somewhat
dependent
upon
them,
and
he
saw
that
a
commerce
with
other
nations
would
certainly
lessen
their
dangerous
importance.
His
avarice
strongly
desired
the
commerce
of
Portugal;
and
his
pride
was
flattered
in
humbling
the
Moors.
After
many
proposals,
it
was
at
last
agreed,
that
of
his
twelve
attendants
he
should
leave
seven
as
hostages;
that
what
goods
were
aboard
his
fleet
should
be
landed;
and
that
Gama
should
be
safely
conducted
to
his
ship,
after
which
the
treaty
of
commerce
and
alliance
was
to
be
finally
settled.
And
thus,
when
the
assassination
of
Gama
seemed
inevitable,
the
zamorim
suddenly
dropped
his
demand
for
the
sails
and
rudders,
rescued
him
from
his
determined
enemies,
and
restored
him
to
liberty
and
the
command
of
his
navy.
As
soon
as
he
was
aboard[60]
the
goods
were
landed,
accompanied
by
a
letter
from
Gama
to
the
zamorim,
wherein
he
boldly
complained
of
the
treachery
of
the
catual.
The
zamorim,
in
answer,
promised
to
make
inquiry,
and
punish
him,
if
guilty;
but
did
nothing
in
the
affair.
Gama,
who
had
now
anchored
nearer
to
the
city,
every
day
sent
two
or
three
different
persons
on
some
business
to
Calicut,
that
as
many
of
his
men
as
possible
might
be
able
to
give
some
account
of
India.
The
Moors,
meanwhile,
every
day
assaulted
the
ears
of
the
king,
who
now
began
to
waver;
when
Gama,
who
had
given
every
proof
of
his
desire
of
peace
and
friendship,
sent
another
letter,
in
which
he
requested
the
zamorim
to
permit
him
to
leave
a
consul
at
Calicut
to
manage
the
affairs
of
King
Emmanuel.
But
to
this
request--the
most
reasonable
result
of
a
commercial
treaty--the
zamorim
returned
a
refusal
full
of
rage
and
indignation.
Gama,
now
fully
master
of
the
character
of
the
zamorim,
resolved
to
treat
a
man
of
such
an
inconstant,
dishonourable
disposition
with
a
contemptuous
silence.
This
contempt
was
felt
by
the
king,
who,
yielding
to
the
advice
of
the
catual
and
the
entreaties
of
the
Moors,
seized
the
Portuguese
goods,
and
ordered
two
of
the
seven
hostages--the
two
who
had
the
charge
of
the
cargo--to
be
put
in
irons.
The
admiral
remonstrated
by
means
of
Monzaida,
but
the
king
still
persisted
in
his
treacherous
breach
of
faith.
Repeated
solicitations
made
him
more
haughty,
and
it
was
now
the
duty
and
interest
of
Gama
to
use
force.
He
took
a
vessel,
in
which
were
six
nayres,
or
noblemen,
and
nineteen
of
their
servants.
The
servants
he
set
ashore
to
relate
the
tidings,
the
noblemen
he
detained.
As
soon
as
the
news
had
time
to
spread
through
the
city,
he
hoisted
his
sails,
and,
though
with
a
slow
motion,
seemed
to
proceed
on
his
homeward
voyage.
The
city
was
now
in
an
uproar;
the
friends
of
the
captive
noblemen
surrounded
the
palace,
and
loudly
accused
the
policy
of
the
Moors.
The
king,
in
all
the
perplexed
distress
of
a
haughty,
avaricious,
weak
prince,
sent
after
Gama,
delivered
up
all
the
hostages,
and
submitted
to
his
proposals;
nay,
even
solicited
that
an
agent
should
be
left,
and
even
descended
to
the
meanness
of
a
palpable
lie.
The
two
factors,
he
said,
he
had
put
in
irons,
only
to
detain
them
till
he
might
write
letters
to
his
brother
Emmanuel,
and
the
goods
he
had
kept
on
shore
that
an
agent
might
be
sent
to
dispose
of
them.
Gama,
however,
perceived
a
mysterious
trifling,
and,
previous
to
any
treaty,
insisted
upon
the
restoration
of
the
goods.
The
day
after
this
altercation
Monzaida
came
aboard
the
fleet
in
great
perturbation.
The
Moors,
he
said,
had
raised
great
commotions,
and
had
enraged
the
king
against
the
Portuguese.
The
king's
ships
were
getting
ready,
and
a
numerous
Moorish
fleet
from
Mecca
was
daily
expected.
To
delay
Gama
till
this
force
arrived
was
the
purpose
of
the
Court
and
of
the
Moors,
who
were
now
confident
of
success.
To
this
information
Monzaida
added,
that
the
Moors,
suspecting
his
attachment
to
Gama,
had
determined
to
assassinate
him;
that
he
had
narrowly
escaped
from
them;
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
recover
his
effects,
and
that
his
only
hope
was
in
the
protection
of
Gama.
Gama
rewarded
him
with
the
friendship
he
merited,
took
him
with
him,
as
he
desired,
to
Lisbon,
and
procured
him
a
recompense
for
his
services.
Almost
immediately
seven
boats
arrived
loaded
with
the
goods,
and
demanded
the
restoration
of
the
captive
noblemen.
Gama
took
the
goods
on
board,
but
refused
to
examine
if
they
were
entire,
and
also
refused
to
deliver
the
prisoners.
He
had
been
promised
an
ambassador
to
his
sovereign,
he
said,
but
had
been
so
often
deluded
he
could
trust
such
a
faithless
people
no
longer,
and
would
therefore
carry
away
the
captives
to
convince
the
King
of
Portugal
what
insults
and
injustice
his
ambassador
and
admiral
had
suffered
from
the
Zamorim
of
Calicut.
Having
thus
dismissed
the
Indians,
he
fired
his
cannon
and
hoisted
his
sails.
A
calm,
however,
detained
him
on
the
coast
some
days;
and
the
zamorim,
seizing
the
opportunity,
sent
what
vessels
he
could
fit
out
(sixty
in
all),
full
of
armed
men,
to
attack
him.
Though
Gama's
cannon
were
well
handled,
confident
of
their
numbers,
they
pressed
on
to
board
him,
when
a
sudden
tempest
arose,
which
Gama's
ships
rode
out
in
safety,
miserably
dispersed
the
Indian
fleet,
and
completed
their
ruin.
After
this
victory
the
admiral
made
a
halt
at
a
little
island
near
the
shore,
where
he
erected
a
cross,[61]
bearing
the
name
and
arms
of
his
Portuguese
majesty.
From
this
place,
by
the
hand
of
Monzaida,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
zamorim,
wherein
he
gave
a
full
and
circumstantial
account
of
all
the
plots
of
the
catual
and
the
Moors.
Still,
however,
he
professed
his
desire
of
a
commercial
treaty,
and
promised
to
represent
the
zamorim
in
the
best
light
to
Emmanuel.
The
prisoners,
he
said,
should
be
kindly
used,
were
only
kept
as
ambassadors
to
his
sovereign,
and
should
be
returned
to
India
when
they
were
enabled
from
experience
to
give
an
account
of
Portugal.
The
letter
he
sent
by
one
of
the
captives,
who
by
this
means
obtained
his
liberty.
The
fame
of
Gama
had
now
spread
over
the
Indian
seas,
and
the
Moors
were
everywhere
intent
on
his
destruction.
As
he
was
near
the
shore
of
Anchediva,
he
beheld
the
appearance
of
a
floating
isle,
covered
with
trees,
advance
towards
him.
But
his
prudence
was
not
to
be
thus
deceived.
A
bold
pirate,
named
Timoja,
by
linking
together
eight
vessels
full
of
men
and
covered
with
green
boughs,
thought
to
board
him
by
surprise.
But
Gama's
cannon
made
seven
of
them
fly;
the
eighth,
loaded
with
fruits
and
provision,
he
took.
The
beautiful
island
of
Anchediva
now
offered
a
convenient
place
to
careen
his
ships
and
refresh
his
men.
While
he
stayed
here,
the
first
minister
of
Zabajo,
king
of
Goa,
one
of
the
most
powerful
princes
of
India,
came
on
board,
and,
in
the
name
of
his
master,
congratulated
the
admiral
in
the
Italian
tongue.
Provisions,
arms,
and
money
were
offered
to
Gama,
and
he
was
entreated
to
accept
the
friendship
of
Zabajo.
The
admiral
was
struck
with
admiration;
the
address
and
abilities
of
the
minister
appeared
so
conspicuous.
He
said
he
was
an
Italian
by
birth,
but
in
sailing
to
Greece,
had
been
taken
by
pirates,
and
after
various
misfortunes,
had
been
necessitated
to
enter
into
the
service
of
a
Mohammedan
prince,
the
nobleness
of
whose
disposition
he
commended
in
the
highest
terms.
Yet,
with
all
his
abilities,
Gama
perceived
an
artful
inquisitiveness--that
nameless
something
which
does
not
accompany
simple
honesty.
After
a
long
conference,
Gama
abruptly
upbraided
him
as
a
spy,
and
ordered
him
to
be
put
to
the
torture.
And
this
soon
brought
a
confession,
that
he
was
a
Polish
Jew
by
birth,
and
was
sent
to
examine
the
strength
of
the
fleet
by
Zabajo,
who
was
mustering
all
his
power
to
attack
the
Portuguese.
Gama,
on
this,
immediately
set
sail,
and
took
the
spy
along
with
him,
who
soon
after
was
baptized,
and
named
Jasper
de
Gama,
the
admiral
being
his
godfather.
He
afterwards
became
of
great
service
to
Emmanuel.
Gama
now
stood
westward
through
the
Indian
Ocean,
and
after
being
long
delayed
by
calms,
arrived
off
Magadoxa,
on
the
coast
of
Africa.
This
place
was
a
principal
port
of
the
Moors;
he
therefore
levelled
the
walls
of
the
city
with
his
cannon,
and
burned
and
destroyed
all
the
ships
in
the
harbour.
Soon
after
this
he
descried
eight
Moorish
vessels
bearing
down
upon
him;
his
artillery,
however,
soon
made
them
use
their
oars
in
flight,
nor
could
Gama
overtake
any
of
them
for
want
of
wind.
The
hospitable
harbour
of
Melinda
was
the
next
place
he
reached.
His
men,
almost
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
sickness,
here
received
a
second
time
every
assistance
which
an
accomplished
and
generous
prince
could
bestow.
And
having
taken
an
ambassador
on
board,
he
again
set
sail,
in
hope
that
he
might
pass
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
while
the
favourable
weather
continued;
for
his
acquaintance
with
the
eastern
seas
now
suggested
to
him
that
the
tempestuous
season
was
periodical.
Soon
after
he
set
sail
his
brother's
ship
struck
on
a
sand
bank,
and
was
burnt
by
order
of
the
admiral.
His
brother
and
part
of
the
crew
he
took
into
his
own
ship,
the
rest
he
sent
on
board
of
Coello's;
nor
were
more
hands
now
alive
than
were
necessary
to
man
the
two
vessels
which
remained.
Having
taken
in
provisions
at
the
island
of
Zanzibar
(where
they
were
kindly
entertained
by
a
Mohammedan
prince
of
the
same
sect
with
the
King
of
Melinda),
they
safely
doubled
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
on
April
26,
1499,
and
continued
till
they
reached
the
island
of
St.
Iago,
in
favourable
weather.
But
a
tempest
here
separated
the
two
ships,
and
gave
Gama
and
Coello
an
opportunity
to
show
the
goodness
of
their
hearts
in
a
manner
which
does
honour
to
human
nature.
The
admiral
was
now
near
the
Azores,
when
Paulus
de
Gama,
long
worn
with
fatigue
and
sickness,
was
unable
to
endure
the
motion
of
the
ship.
Vasco,
therefore,
put
into
the
island
of
Tercera,
in
hope
of
his
brother's
recovery.
And
such
was
his
affection,
that
rather
than
leave
him
he
gave
the
command
of
his
ship
to
one
of
his
officers.
But
the
hope
of
recovery
was
vain.
John
de
Sa
proceeded
to
Lisbon
with
the
flag
ship,
while
the
admiral
remained
behind
to
soothe
the
deathbed
of
his
brother,
and
perform
his
funeral
rites.
Coello,
meanwhile,
landed
at
Lisbon,
and
hearing
that
Gama
had
not
arrived,
imagined
he
might
either
be
shipwrecked
or
beating
about
in
distress.
Without
seeing
one
of
his
family
he
immediately
set
sail
again,
on
purpose
to
bring
relief
to
his
friend
and
admiral.
But
this
generous
design
was
prevented
by
an
order
from
the
king,
ere
he
got
out
of
the
Tagus.
The
particulars
of
the
voyage
were
now
diffused
by
Coello,
and
the
joy
of
the
king
was
only
equalled
by
the
admiration
of
the
people.
Yet,
while
all
the
nation
was
fired
with
zeal
to
express
their
esteem
of
the
happy
admiral,
he
himself,
the
man
who
was
such
an
enthusiast
to
the
success
of
his
voyage
that
he
would
willingly
have
sacrificed
his
life
in
India
to
secure
that
success,
was
now
in
the
completion
of
it
a
dejected
mourner.
The
compliments
of
the
Court,
and
the
shouts
of
the
street,
were
irksome
to
him;
for
his
brother,
the
companion
of
his
toils
and
dangers,
was
not
there
to
share
the
joy.
As
soon
as
he
had
waited
on
the
king,
he
shut
himself
up
in
a
lonely
house
near
the
seaside
at
Belem,
from
whence
it
was
some
time
ere
he
was
drawn
to
mingle
in
public
life.
During
this
important
expedition,
two
years
and
almost
two
months
elapsed.
Of
160
men
who
went
out,
only
55
returned.
These
were
all
rewarded
by
the
king.
Coello
was
pensioned
with
100
ducats
a
year,
and
made
a
fidalgo,
or
gentleman
of
the
king's
household,
a
degree
of
nobility
in
Portugal.
The
title
of
Don
was
annexed
to
the
family
of
Vasco
de
Gama.
He
was
appointed
admiral
of
the
eastern
seas,
with
an
annual
salary
of
3000
ducats,
and
a
part
of
the
king's
arms
was
added
to
his.
Public
thanksgivings
to
Heaven
were
celebrated
throughout
the
churches
of
the
kingdom;
while
feasts,
dramatic
performances,
and
chivalrous
entertainments
(or
tournaments),
according
to
the
taste
of
that
age,
demonstrated
the
joy
of
Portugal.
Pedro
Alvarez
Cabral
was
the
second
Portuguese
admiral
who
sailed
for
India.
He
entered
into
alliance
with
Trimumpara,
king
of
Cochin,
and
high
priest
of
Malabar.
(See
Bk.
x.
p.
302.)
Gama,
having
left
six
ships
for
the
protection
of
Cochin
and
Cananor,
had
sailed
for
Portugal
with
twelve
ships,
laden
with
the
riches
of
the
East.
As
soon
as
his
departure
was
made
known,
the
zamorim
made
great
preparations
to
attack
Cochin--a
city
situated
on
an
island,
divided
by
an
arm
of
the
sea
from
the
main-land.
At
one
part,
however,
this
creek
was
fordable
at
low
water.
The
zamorim
having
renewed
the
war,
at
length,
by
force
of
numbers
and
bribery,
took
the
city;
and
the
King
of
Cochin,
stripped
of
his
dominions,
but
still
faithful
to
the
Portuguese,
fled
to
the
island
of
Viopia.
Francisco
Albuquerque,
with
other
commanders,
having
heard
of
the
fate
of
Cochin,
set
sail
for
its
relief;
the
garrison
of
the
zamorim
fled,
and
Trimumpara
was
restored
to
his
throne.
Every
precaution
by
which
the
passage
to
the
island
of
Cochin
might
be
secured
was
now
taken
by
Pacheco.
The
Portuguese
took
the
sacrament,
and
devoted
themselves
to
death.
The
King
of
Cochin's
troops
amounted
only
to
5000
men,
while
the
army
of
the
zamorim
numbered
57,000,
provided
with
brass
cannon,
and
assisted
by
two
Italian
engineers.
Yet
this
immense
army,
laying
siege
to
Cochin,
was
defeated.
Seven
times
the
zamorim
raised
new
armies;
yet
they
were
all
vanquished
at
the
fords
of
Cochin,
by
the
intrepidity
and
stratagems
of
Pacheco.
In
the
later
battles
the
zamorim
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
danger,
and
was
sometimes
sprinkled
with
the
blood
of
his
slain
attendants--a
circumstance
mentioned
in
the
Lusiad,
bk.
x.
p.
304.
He
then
had
recourse
to
fraud
and
poison;
but
all
his
attempts
were
baffled.
At
last,
in
despair,
he
resigned
his
throne,
and
shut
himself
up
for
the
rest
of
his
days
in
one
of
the
temples.
Soon
after
the
kingdom
of
Cochin
was
restored
to
prosperity
Pacheco
was
recalled.
The
King
of
Portugal
paid
the
highest
compliments
to
his
valour,
and
gave
him
the
government
of
a
possession
of
the
crown
in
Africa.
But
merit
always
has
enemies:
Pacheco
was
accused
and
brought
to
Lisbon
in
irons,
where
he
remained
for
a
considerable
time
chained
in
a
dungeon.
He
was
at
length
tried,
and
after
a
full
investigation
of
the
charges
made
against
him,
was
honourably
acquitted.
His
services
to
his
country
were
soon
forgotten,
his
merits
were
no
longer
thought
of,
and
the
unfortunate
Pacheco
ended
his
days
in
an
alms-house--a
circumstance
referred
to
in
the
Lusiad,

who
from

Thro'

where
sail
was
never
spread
before,
Beyond
where
Ceylon
lifts
her
spicy
breast,
And
waves
her
woods
above
the
wat'ry
waste,
With
prowess
more
than
human
forc'd
their
way
To
the
fair
kingdoms
of
the
rising
day:
What
wars
they
wag'd,
what
seas,
what
dangers
pass'd,
What
glorious
empire
crown'd
their
toils
at
last,
Vent'rous
I
sing,
on
soaring
pinions
borne,
And
all
my
country's
wars[64]
the
song
adorn;
What
kings,
what
heroes
of
my
native
land
Thunder'd
on
Asia's
and
on
Afric's
strand:
Illustrious
shades,
who
levell'd
in
the
dust
The
idol-temples
and
the
shrines
of
lust:
And
where,
erewhile,
foul
demons
were
rever'd,
To
Holy
Faith
unnumber'd
altars
rear'd:[65]
Illustrious
names,
with
deathless
laurels
crown'd,
While
time
rolls
on
in
every
clime
renown'd!
Let
Fame
with
wonder
name
the
Greek[66]
no
more,
What
lands
he
saw,
what
toils
at
sea
he
bore;
Nor
more
the
Trojan's
wand'ring[67]
voyage
boast,
What
storms
he
brav'd
on
many
a
perilous
coast:
No
more
let
Rome
exult
in
Trajan's
name,
Nor
Eastern
conquests
Ammon's[68]
pride
proclaim;
A
nobler
hero's
deeds
demand
my
lays
Than
e'er
adorn'd
the
song
of
ancient
days,
Illustrious
GAMA,[69]
whom
the
waves
obey'd,
And
whose
dread
sword
the
fate
of
empire
sway'd.
And
you,
fair
nymphs
of
Tagus,
parent
stream,
If
e'er
your
meadows
were
my
pastoral
theme,
While
you
have
listen'd,
and
by
moonshine
seen
My
footsteps
wander
o'er
your
banks
of
green,
O
come
auspicious,
and
the
song
inspire
With
all
the
boldness
of
your
hero's
fire:
Deep
and
majestic
let
the
numbers
flow,
And,
rapt
to
heaven,
with
ardent
fury
glow,
Unlike
the
verse
that
speaks
the
lover's
grief,
When
heaving
sighs
afford
their
soft
relief,
And
humble
reeds
bewail
the
shepherd's
pain;
But
like
the
warlike
trumpet
be
the
strain
To
rouse
the
hero's
ire,
and
far
around,
With
equal
rage,
your
warriors'
deeds
resound.
And
thou,[70]
O
born
the
pledge
of
happier
days,
To
guard
our
freedom
and
our
glories
raise,
Given
to
the
world
to
spread
Religion's
sway,
And
pour
o'er
many
a
land
the
mental
day,
Thy
future
honours
on
thy
shield
behold,
The
cross
and
victor's
wreath
emboss'd
in
gold:
At
thy
commanding
frown
we
trust
to
see,
The
Turk
and
Arab
bend
the
suppliant
knee:
Beneath
the
morn,[71]
dread
king,
thine
empire
lies,
When
midnight
veils
thy
Lusitanian[72]
skies;
And
when,
descending
in
the
western
main,
The
sun[73]
still
rises
on
thy
length'ning
reign:
Thou
blooming
scion
of
the
noblest
stem,
Our
nation's
safety,
and
our
age's
gem,
O
young
Sebastian,
hasten
to
the
prime
Of
manly
youth,
to
Fame's
high
temple
climb:
Yet
now
attentive
hear
the
Muse's
lay
While
thy
green
years
to
manhood
speed
away:
The
youthful
terrors
of
thy
brow
suspend,
And,
oh,
propitious
to
the
song
attend--
The
num'rous
song,
by
patriot-passion
fir'd,
And
by
the
glories
of
thy
race
inspir'd:
To
be
the
herald
of
my
country's
fame
My
first
ambition
and
my
dearest
aim:
Nor
conquests
fabulous
nor
actions
vain,
The
Muse's
pastime,
here
adorn
the
strain:
Orlando's
fury,
and
Rugero's
rage,
And
all
the
heroes
of
th'
Aonian
page,[74]
The
dreams
of
bards
surpass'd
the
world
shall
view,
And
own
their
boldest
fictions
may
be
true;
Surpass'd
and
dimm'd
by
the
superior
blaze
Of
GAMA'S
mighty
deeds,
which
here
bright
Truth
displays.
Nor
more
let
History
boast
her
heroes
old,
Their
glorious
rivals
here,
dread
prince,
behold:
Here
shine
the
valiant
Nunio's
deeds
unfeign'd,
Whose
single
arm
the
falling
state
sustain'd;
Here
fearless
Egas'
wars,
and,
Fuas,
thine,
To
give
full
ardour
to
the
song
combine;
But
ardour
equal
to
your
martial
ire
Demands
the
thund'ring
sounds
of
Homer's
lyre.
To
match
the
Twelve
so
long
by
bards
renown'd,[75]
Here
brave
Magricio
and
his
peers
are
crown'd
(A
glorious
Twelve!)
with
deathless
laurels,
won
In
gallant
arms
before
the
English
throne.
Unmatch'd
no
more
the
Gallic
Charles
shall
stand,
Nor
Cæsar's
name
the
first
of
praise
command:
Of
nobler
acts
the
crown'd
Alonzo[76]
see,
Thy
valiant
sires,
to
whom
the
bended
knee
Of
vanquish'd
Afric
bow'd.
Nor
less
in
fame,
He
who
confin'd
the
rage
of
civil
flame,
The
godlike
John,
beneath
whose
awful
sword
Rebellion
crouch'd,
and
trembling
own'd
him
lord
Those
heroes,
too,
who
thy
bold
flag
unfurl'd,
And
spread
thy
banners
o'er
the
Eastern
world,
Whose
spears
subdu'd
the
kingdoms
of
the
morn,
Their
names
and
glorious
wars
the
song
adorn:
The
daring
GAMA,
whose
unequall'd
name
(Proud
monarch)
shines
o'er
all
of
naval
fame:
Castro
the
bold,
in
arms
a
peerless
knight,
And
stern
Pacheco,
dreadful
in
the
fight:
The
two
Almeydas,
names
for
ever
dear,
By
Tago's
nymphs
embalm'd
with
many
a
tear;
Ah,
still
their
early
fate
the
nymphs
shall
mourn,
And
bathe
with
many
a
tear
their
hapless
urn:
Nor
shall
the
godlike
Albuquerque
restrain
The
Muse's
fury;
o'er
the
purpled
plain
The
Muse
shall
lead
him
in
his
thund'ring
car
Amidst
his
glorious
brothers
of
the
war,
Whose
fame
in
arms
resounds
from
sky
to
sky,
And
bids
their
deeds
the
power
of
death
defy.
And
while,
to
thee,
I
tune
the
duteous
lay,
Assume,
O
potent
king,
thine
empire's
sway;
With
thy
brave
host
through
Afric
march
along,
And
give
new
triumphs
to
immortal
song:
On
thee
with
earnest
eyes
the
nations
wait,
And,
cold
with
dread,
the
Moor
expects
his
fate;
The
barb'rous
mountaineer
on
Taurus'
brows
To
thy
expected
yoke
his
shoulder
bows;
Fair
Thetis
woos
thee
with
her
blue
domain,
Her
nuptial
son,
and
fondly
yields
her
reign,
And
from
the
bow'rs
of
heav'n
thy
grandsires[77]
see
Their
various
virtues
bloom
afresh
in
thee;
One
for
the
joyful
days
of
peace
renown'd,
And
one
with
war's
triumphant
laurels
crown'd:
With
joyful
hands,
to
deck
thy
manly
brow,
They
twine
the
laurel
and
the
olive-bough;
With
joyful
eyes
a
glorious
throne
they
see,
In
Fame's
eternal
dome,
reserv'd
for
thee.
Yet,
while
thy
youthful
hand
delays
to
wield
The
sceptre'd
power,
or
thunder
of
the
field,
Here
view
thine
Argonauts,
in
seas
unknown,
And
all
the
terrors
of
the
burning
zone,
Till
their
proud
standards,
rear'd
in
other
skies,
And
all
their
conquests
meet
thy
wond'ring[78]
eyes.
Now,
far
from
land,
o'er
Neptune's
dread
abode
The
Lusitanian
fleet
triumphant
rode;
Onward
they
traced
the
wide
and
lonesome
main,
Where
changeful
Proteus
leads
his
scaly
train;
The
dancing
vanes
before
the
zephyrs
flow'd,
And
their
bold
keels
the
trackless
ocean
plough'd;
Unplough'd
before,
the
green-ting'd
billows
rose,
And
curl'd
and
whiten'd
round
the
nodding
prows.
When
Jove,
the
god
who
with
a
thought
controls
The
raging
seas,
and
balances
the
poles,
From
heav'n
beheld,
and
will'd,
in
sov'reign
state,
To
fix
the
Eastern
World's
depending
fate,
Swift
at
his
nod
th'
Olympian
herald
flies,
And
calls
th'
immortal
senate
of
the
skies;
Where,
from
the
sov'reign
throne
of
earth
and
heav'n,
Th'
immutable
decrees
of
fate
are
given.
Instant
the
regents
of
the
spheres
of
light,
And
those
who
rule
the
paler
orbs
of
night,
With
those,
the
gods
whose
delegated
sway
The
burning
South
and
frozen
North
obey;
And
they
whose
empires
see
the
day-star
rise,
And
evening
Phœbus
leave
the
western
skies,
All
instant
pour'd
along
the
milky
road,
Heaven's
crystal
pavements
glitt'ring
as
they
trod:
And
now,
obedient
to
the
dread
command,
Before
their
awful
lord
in
order
stand.
Sublime
and
dreadful
on
his
regal
throne,
That
glow'd
with
stars,
and
bright
as
lightning
shone,
Th'
immortal
Sire,
who
darts
the
thunder,
sat,
The
crown
and
sceptre
added
solemn
state;
The
crown,
of
heaven's
own
pearls,
whose
ardent
rays,
Flam'd
round
his
brows,
outshone
the
diamond's
blaze:
His
breath
such
gales
of
vital
fragrance
shed,
As
might,
with
sudden
life,
inspire
the
dead:
Supreme
Control
thron'd
in
his
awful
eyes
Appear'd,
and
mark'd
the
monarch
of
the
skies.
On
seats
that
burn'd
with
pearl
and
ruddy
gold,
The
subject
gods
their
sov'reign
lord
enfold,
Each
in
his
rank,
when
with
a
voice
that
shook
The
tow'rs
of
heav'n,
the
world's
dread
ruler
spoke:
"Immortal
heirs
of
light,
my
purpose
hear,
My
counsels
ponder,
and
the
Fates
revere:
Unless
Oblivion
o'er
your
minds
has
thrown
Her
dark
blank
shades,
to
you,
ye
gods,
are
known
The
Fate's
decree,
and
ancient
warlike
fame
Of
that
bold
race
which
boasts
of
Lusus'
name;
That
bold
advent'rous
race,
the
Fates
declare,
A
potent
empire
in
the
East
shall
rear,
Surpassing
Babel's
or
the
Persian
fame,
Proud
Grecia's
boast,
or
Rome's
illustrious
name.
Oft
from
these
brilliant
seats
have
you
beheld
The
sons
of
Lusus
on
the
dusty
field,
Though
few,
triumphant
o'er
the
num'rous
Moors,
Till,
from
the
beauteous
lawns
on
Tagus'
shores
They
drove
the
cruel
foe.
And
oft
has
heav'n
Before
their
troops
the
proud
Castilians
driv'n;
While
Victory
her
eagle-wings
display'd
Where'er
their
warriors
wav'd
the
shining
blade,
Nor
rests
unknown
how
Lusus'
heroes
stood
When
Rome's
ambition
dyed
the
world
with
blood;
What
glorious
laurels
Viriatus[79]
gain'd,
How
oft
his
sword
with
Roman
gore
was
stain'd;
And
what
fair
palms
their
martial
ardour
crown'd,
When
led
to
battle
by
the
chief
renown'd,
Who[80]
feign'd
a
dæmon,
in
a
deer
conceal'd,
To
him
the
counsels
of
the
gods
reveal'd.
And
now,
ambitious
to
extend
their
sway
Beyond
their
conquests
on
the
southmost
bay
Of
Afric's
swarthy
coast,
on
floating
wood
They
brave
the
terrors
of
the
dreary
flood,
Where
only
black-wing'd
mists
have
hover'd
o'er,
Or
driving
clouds
have
sail'd
the
wave
before;
Beneath
new
skies
they
hold
their
dreadful
way
To
reach
the
cradle
of
the
new-born
day:
And
Fate,
whose
mandates
unrevok'd
remain,
Has
will'd
that
long
shall
Lusus'
offspring
reign
The
lords
of
that
wide
sea,
whose
waves
behold
The
sun
come
forth
enthron'd
in
burning
gold.
But
now,
the
tedious
length
of
winter
past,
Distress'd
and
weak,
the
heroes
faint
at
last.
What
gulfs
they
dar'd,
you
saw,
what
storms
they
brav'd,
Beneath
what
various
heav'ns
their
banners
wav'd!
Now
Mercy
pleads,
and
soon
the
rising
land
To
their
glad
eyes
shall
o'er
the
waves
expand;
As
welcome
friends
the
natives
shall
receive,
With
bounty
feast
them,
and
with
joy
relieve.
And,
when
refreshment
shall
their
strength
renew,
Thence
shall
they
turn,
and
their
bold
route
pursue."
So
spoke
high
Jove:
the
gods
in
silence
heard,
Then
rising,
each
by
turns
his
thoughts
preferr'd:
But
chief
was
Bacchus
of
the
adverse
train;
Fearful
he
was,
nor
fear'd
his
pride
in
vain,
Should
Lusus'
race
arrive
on
India's
shore,
His
ancient
honours
would
be
known
no
more;
No
more
in
Nysa[81]
should
the
native
tell
What
kings,
what
mighty
hosts
before
him
fell.
The
fertile
vales
beneath
the
rising
sun
He
view'd
as
his,
by
right
of
victory
won,
And
deem'd
that
ever
in
immortal
song
The
Conqueror's
title
should
to
him
belong.
Yet
Fate,
he
knew,
had
will'd,
that
loos'd
from
Spain
Boldly
advent'rous
thro'
the
polar
main,
A
warlike
race
should
come,
renown'd
in
arms,
And
shake
the
eastern
world
with
war's
alarms,
Whose
glorious
conquests
and
eternal
fame
In
black
Oblivion's
waves
should
whelm
his
name.
Urania-Venus,[82]
queen
of
sacred
love,
Arose
and
fixed
her
asking
eyes
on
Jove;
Her
eyes,
well
pleas'd,
in
Lusus'
sons
could
trace
A
kindred
likeness
to
the
Roman
race,
For
whom
of
old
such
kind
regard
she
bore;[83]
The
same
their
triumphs
on
Barbaria's
shore,
The
same
the
ardour
of
their
warlike
flame,
The
manly
music
of
their
tongue
the
same:[84]
Affection
thus
the
lovely
goddess
sway'd,
Nor
less
what
Fate's
unblotted
page
display'd,
Where'er
this
people
should
their
empire
raise,
She
knew
her
altars
would
unnumber'd
blaze,
And
barb'rous
nations
at
her
holy
shrine
Be
humaniz'd
and
taught
her
lore
divine.
Her
spreading
honours
thus
the
one
inspir'd,
And
one
the
dread
to
lose
his
worship
fir'd.
Their
struggling
factions
shook
th'
Olympian
state
With
all
the
clam'rous
tempest
of
debate.
Thus,
when
the
storm
with
sudden
gust
invades
The
ancient
forest's
deep
and
lofty
shades,
The
bursting
whirlwinds
tear
their
rapid
course,
The
shatter'd
oaks
crash,
and
with
echoes
hoarse
The
mountains
groan,
while
whirling
on
the
blast
The
thick'ning
leaves
a
gloomy
darkness
cast;
Such
was
the
tumult
in
the
blest
abodes,
When
Mars,
high
tow'ring
o'er
the
rival
gods,
Stepp'd
forth:
stern
sparkles
from
his
eye-balls
glanc'd,
And
now,
before
the
throne
of
Jove
advanc'd,
O'er
his
left
shoulder
his
broad
shield
he
throws,
And
lifts
his
helm[85]
above
his
dreadful
brows:
Bold
and
enrag'd
he
stands,
and,
frowning
round,
Strikes
his
tall
spear-staff
on
the
sounding
ground;
Heav'n
trembled,
and
the
light
turn'd
pale[86]--such
dread
His
fierce
demeanour
o'er
Olympus
spread--
When
thus
the
warrior:
"O
Eternal
Sire,
Thine
is
the
sceptre,
thine
the
thunder's
fire,
Supreme
dominion
thine;
then,
Father,
hear,
Shall
that
bold
race
which
once
to
thee
was
dear,
Who,
now
fulfilling
thy
decrees
of
old,
Through
these
wild
waves
their
fearless
journey
hold,
Shall
that
bold
race
no
more
thy
care
engage,
But
sink
the
victims
of
unhallow'd
rage!
Did
Bacchus
yield
to
Reason's
voice
divine,
Bacchus
the
cause
of
Lusus'
sons
would
join,
Lusus,
the
lov'd
companion
of
his
cares,
His
earthly
toils,
his
dangers,
and
his
wars:
But
envy
still
a
foe
to
worth
will
prove,
To
worth,
though
guarded
by
the
arm
of
Jove.
"Then
thou,
dread
Lord
of
Fate,
unmov'd
remain,
Nor
let
weak
change
thine
awful
counsels
stain,
For
Lusus'
race
thy
promis'd
favour
show;
Swift
as
the
arrow
from
Apollo's
bow
Let
Maia's[87]
son
explore
the
wat'ry
way,
Where,
spent
with
toil,
with
weary
hopes,
they
stray;
And
safe
to
harbour,
through
the
deep
untried,
Let
him,
empower'd,
their
wand'ring
vessels
guide;
There
let
them
hear
of
India's
wish'd-for
shore,
And
balmy
rest
their
fainting
strength
restore."
He
spoke:
high
Jove
assenting
bow'd
the
head,
And
floating
clouds
of
nectar'd
fragrance
shed:
Then,
lowly
bending
to
th'
Eternal
Sire,
Each
in
his
duteous
rank,
the
gods
retire.
Whilst
thus
in
heaven's
bright
palace
fate
was
weigh'd
Right
onward
still
the
brave
Armada
strayed:
Right
on
they
steer
by
Ethiopia's
strand
And
pastoral
Madagascar's[88]
verdant
land.
Before
the
balmy
gales
of
cheerful
spring,
With
heav'n
their
friend,
they
spread
the
canvas
wing,
The
sky
cerulean,
and
the
breathing
air,
The
lasting
promise
of
a
calm
declare.
Behind
them
now
the
Cape
of
Praso[89]
bends,
Another
ocean
to
their
view
extends,
Where
black-topp'd
islands,
to
their
longing
eyes,
Lav'd
by
the
gentle
waves,[90]
in
prospect
rise.
But
GAMA
(captain
of
the
vent'rous
band,
Of
bold
emprize,
and
born
for
high
command,
Whose
martial
fires,
with
prudence
close
allied,
Ensur'd
the
smiles
of
fortune
on
his
side)
Bears
off
those
shores
which
waste
and
wild
appear'd,
And
eastward
still
for
happier
climates
steer'd:
When
gath'ring
round,
and
black'ning
o'er
the
tide,
A
fleet
of
small
canoes
the
pilot
spied;
Hoisting
their
sails
of
palm-tree
leaves,
inwove
With
curious
art,
a
swarming
crowd
they
move:
Long
were
their
boats,
and
sharp
to
bound
along
Through
the
dash'd
waters,
broad
their
oars
and
strong:
The
bending
rowers
on
their
features
bore
The
swarthy
marks
of
Phaeton's[91]
fall
of
yore:
When
flaming
lightnings
scorch'd
the
banks
of
Po,
And
nations
blacken'd
in
the
dread
o'erthrow.
Their
garb,
discover'd
as
approaching
nigh,
Was
cotton
strip'd
with
many
a
gaudy
dye:
'Twas
one
whole
piece
beneath
one
arm
confin'd,
The
rest
hung
loose
and
flutter'd
on
the
wind;
All,
but
one
breast,
above
the
loins
was
bare,
And
swelling
turbans
bound
their
jetty
hair:
Their
arms
were
bearded
darts
and
faulchions
broad,
And
warlike
music
sounded
as
they
row'd.
With
joy
the
sailors
saw
the
boats
draw
near,
With
joy
beheld
the
human
face
appear:
What
nations
these,
their
wond'ring
thoughts
explore,
What
rites
they
follow,
and
what
God
adore!
And
now
with
hands
and
'kerchiefs
wav'd
in
air
The
barb'rous
race
their
friendly
mind
declare.
Glad
were
the
crew,
and
ween'd
that
happy
day
Should
end
their
dangers
and
their
toils
repay.
The
lofty
masts
the
nimble
youths
ascend,
The
ropes
they
haul,
and
o'er
the
yard-arms
bend;
And
now
their
bowsprits
pointing
to
the
shore,
(A
safe
moon'd
bay),
with
slacken'd
sails
they
bore:
With
cheerful
shouts
they
furl
the
gather'd
sail
That
less
and
less
flaps
quiv'ring
on
the
gale;
The
prows,
their
speed
stopp'd,
o'er
the
surges
nod,
The
falling
anchors
dash
the
foaming
flood;
When,
sudden
as
they
stopp'd,
the
swarthy
race,
With
smiles
of
friendly
welcome
on
each
face,
The
ship's
high
sides
swift
by
the
cordage
climb:
Illustrious
GAMA,
with
an
air
sublime,
Soften'd
by
mild
humanity,
receives,
And
to
their
chief
the
hand
of
friendship
gives,
Bids
spread
the
board,
and,
instant
as
he
said,
Along
the
deck
the
festive
board
is
spread:
The
sparkling
wine
in
crystal
goblets
glows,
And
round
and
round
with
cheerful
welcome
flows.
While
thus
the
vine
its
sprightly
glee
inspires,
From
whence
the
fleet,
the
swarthy
chief
enquires,
What
seas
they
past,
what
'vantage
would
attain,
And
what
the
shore
their
purpose
hop'd
to
gain?
"From
farthest
west,"
the
Lusian
race
reply,
"To
reach
the
golden
Eastern
shores
we
try.
Through
that
unbounded
sea
whose
billows
roll
From
the
cold
northern
to
the
southern
pole;
And
by
the
wide
extent,
the
dreary
vast
Of
Afric's
bays,
already
have
we
past;
And
many
a
sky
have
seen,
and
many
a
shore,
Where
but
sea
monsters
cut
the
waves
before.
To
spread
the
glories
of
our
monarch's
reign,
For
India's
shore
we
brave
the
trackless
main,
Our
glorious
toil,
and
at
his
nod
would
brave
The
dismal
gulfs
of
Acheron's[92]
black
wave.
And
now,
in
turn,
your
race,
your
country
tell,
If
on
your
lips
fair
truth
delights
to
dwell
To
us,
unconscious
of
the
falsehood,
show
What
of
these
seas
and
India's
site
you
know."
"Rude
are
the
natives
here,"
the
Moor
replied;
"Dark
are
their
minds,
and
brute-desire
their
guide:
But
we,
of
alien
blood,
and
strangers
here,
Nor
hold
their
customs
nor
their
laws
revere.
From
Abram's
race
our
holy
prophet
sprung,[93]
An
angel
taught,
and
heaven
inspir'd
his
tongue;
His
sacred
rites
and
mandates
we
obey,
And
distant
empires
own
his
holy
sway.
From
isle
to
isle
our
trading
vessels
roam,
Mozambique's
harbour
our
commodious
home.
If
then
your
sails
for
India's
shore
expand,
For
sultry
Ganges
or
Hydaspes'[94]
strand,
Here
shall
you
find
a
pilot
skill'd
to
guide
Through
all
the
dangers
of
the
perilous
tide,
Though
wide-spread
shelves,
and
cruel
rocks
unseen,
Lurk
in
the
way,
and
whirlpools
rage
between.
Accept,
meanwhile,
what
fruits
these
islands
hold,
And
to
the
regent
let
your
wish
be
told.
Then
may
your
mates
the
needful
stores
provide,
And
all
your
various
wants
be
here
supplied."
So
spake
the
Moor,
and
bearing
smiles
untrue
And
signs
of
friendship,
with
his
bands
withdrew.
O'erpower'd
with
joy
unhop'd
the
sailors
stood,
To
find
such
kindness
on
a
shore
so
rude.
Now
shooting
o'er
the
flood
his
fervid
blaze,
The
red-brow'd
sun
withdraws
his
beamy
rays;
Safe
in
the
bay
the
crew
forget
their
cares,
And
peaceful
rest
their
wearied
strength
repairs.
Calm
twilight
now[95]
his
drowsy
mantle
spreads,
And
shade
on
shade,
the
gloom
still
deep'ning,
sheds.
The
moon,
full
orb'd,
forsakes
her
wat'ry
cave,
And
lifts
her
lovely
head
above
the
wave.
The
snowy
splendours
of
her
modest
ray
Stream
o'er
the
glist'ning
waves,
and
quiv'ring
play:
Around
her,
glitt'ring
on
the
heaven's
arch'd
brow,
Unnumber'd
stars,
enclos'd
in
azure,
glow,
Thick
as
the
dew-drops
of
the
April
dawn,
Or
May-flowers
crowding
o'er
the
daisy-lawn:
The
canvas
whitens
in
the
silvery
beam,
And
with
a
mild
pale
red
the
pendants
gleam:
The
masts'
tall
shadows
tremble
o'er
the
deep;
The
peaceful
winds
a
holy
silence
keep;
The
watchman's
carol,
echo'd
from
the
prows,
Alone,
at
times,
awakes
the
still
repose.
Aurora
now,
with
dewy
lustre
bright,
Appears,
ascending
on
the
rear
of
night.
With
gentle
hand,
as
seeming
oft
to
pause,
The
purple
curtains
of
the
morn
she
draws;
The
sun
comes
forth,
and
soon
the
joyful
crew,
Each
aiding
each,
their
joyful
tasks
pursue.
Wide
o'er
the
decks
the
spreading
sails
they
throw;
From
each
tall
mast
the
waving
streamers
flow;
All
seems
a
festive
holiday
on
board
To
welcome
to
the
fleet
the
island's
lord.
With
equal
joy
the
regent
sails
to
meet,
And
brings
fresh
cates,
his
off'rings,
to
the
fleet:
For
of
his
kindred
race
their
line
he
deems,
That
savage
race[96]
who
rush'd
from
Caspia's
streams,
And
triumph'd
o'er
the
East,
and,
Asia
won,
In
proud
Byzantium[97]
fix'd
their
haughty
throne.
Brave
VASCO
hails
the
chief
with
honest
smiles,
And
gift
for
gift
with
liberal
hand
he
piles.
His
gifts,
the
boast
of
Europe's
heart
disclose,
And
sparkling
red
the
wine
of
Tagus
flows.
High
on
the
shrouds
the
wond'ring
sailors
hung,
To
note
the
Moorish
garb,
and
barb'rous
tongue:
Nor
less
the
subtle
Moor,
with
wonder
fir'd,
Their
mien,
their
dress,
and
lordly
ships
admir'd:
Much
he
enquires
their
king's,
their
country's
name,
And,
if
from
Turkey's
fertile
shores
they
came?
What
God
they
worshipp'd,
what
their
sacred
lore,
What
arms
they
wielded,
and
what
armour
wore?
To
whom
brave
GAMA:
"Nor
of
Hagar's
blood
Am
I,
nor
plough
from
Ismael's
shores
the
flood;
From
Europe's
strand
I
trace
the
foamy
way,
To
find
the
regions
of
the
infant
day.
The
God
we
worship
stretch'd
yon
heaven's
high
bow,
And
gave
these
swelling
waves
to
roll
below;
The
hemispheres
of
night
and
day
He
spread,
He
scoop'd
each
vale,
and
rear'd
each
mountain's
head;
His
Word
produc'd
the
nations
of
the
earth,
And
gave
the
spirits
of
the
sky
their
birth;
On
earth,
by
Him,
his
holy
lore
was
given,
On
earth
He
came
to
raise
mankind
to
heaven.
And
now
behold,
what
most
your
eyes
desire,
Our
shining
armour,
and
our
arms
of
fire;
For
who
has
once
in
friendly
peace
beheld,
Will
dread
to
meet
them
on
the
battle
field."
Straight
as
he
spoke[98]
the
warlike
stores
display'd
Their
glorious
show,
where,
tire
on
tire
inlaid,
Appear'd
of
glitt'ring
steel
the
carabines,
There
the
plum'd
helms,[99]
and
pond'rous
brigandines;[100]
O'er
the
broad
bucklers
sculptur'd
orbs
emboss'd
The
crooked
faulchions,
dreadful
blades
were
cross'd:
Here
clasping
greaves,
and
plated
mail-quilts
strong;
The
long-bows
here,
and
rattling
quivers
hung,
And
like
a
grove
the
burnish'd
spears
were
seen,
With
darts
and
halberts
double-edged
between;
Here
dread
grenadoes
and
tremendous
bombs,
With
deaths
ten
thousand
lurking
in
their
wombs,
And
far
around,
of
brown
and
dusky
red,
The
pointed
piles
of
iron
balls
were
spread.
The
bombardiers,
now
to
the
regent's
view
The
thund'ring
mortars
and
the
cannon
drew;
Yet,
at
their
leader's
nod,
the
sons
of
flame
(For
brave
and
gen'rous
ever
are
the
same)
Withheld
their
hands,
nor
gave
the
seeds
of
fire
To
rouse
the
thunders
of
the
dreadful
tire.
For
GAMA'S
soul
disdain'd
the
pride
of
show
Which
acts
the
lion
o'er
the
trembling
roe.
His
joy
and
wonder
oft
the
Moor
express'd,
But
rankling
hate
lay
brooding
in
his
breast;
With
smiles
obedient
to
his
will's
control,
He
veils
the
purpose
of
his
treach'rous
soul:
For
pilots,
conscious
of
the
Indian
strand,
Brave
VASCO
sues,
and
bids
the
Moor
command
What
bounteous
gifts
shall
recompense
their
toils;
The
Moor
prevents
him
with
assenting
smiles,
Resolved
that
deeds
of
death,
not
words
of
air,
Shall
first
the
hatred
of
his
soul
declare;
Such
sudden
rage
his
rankling
mind
possess'd,
When
GAMA'S
lips
Messiah's
name
confess'd.[101]
Oh
depth
of
Heaven's
dread
will,
that
ranc'rous
hate
On
Heaven's
best
lov'd
in
ev'ry
clime
should
wait!
Now,
smiling
round
on
all
the
wond'ring
crew
The
Moor,
attended
by
his
bands,
withdrew;
His
nimble
barges
soon
approach'd
the
land,
And
shouts
of
joy
receiv'd
him
on
the
strand.
From
heaven's
high
dome
the
vintage-god[102]
beheld
(Whom
nine
long
months
his
father's
thigh
conceal'd);[103]
Well
pleas'd
he
mark'd
the
Moor's
determin'd
hate
And
thus
his
mind
revolv'd
in
self-debate:--
"Has
Heaven,
indeed,
such
glorious
lot
ordain'd,
By
Lusus'
race
such
conquests
to
be
gain'd
O'er
warlike
nations,
and
on
India's
shore,
Where
I,
unrivall'd,
claim'd
the
palm
before?
I,
sprung
from
Jove!
And
shall
these
wand'ring
few,
What
Ammon's
son[104]
unconquer'd
left,
subdue
Ammon's
brave
son
who
led
the
god
of
war
His
slave
auxiliar
at
his
thund'ring
car?
Must
these
possess
what
Jove
to
him
denied,
Possess
what
never
sooth'd
the
Roman
pride?
Must
these
the
victor's
lordly
flag
display
With
hateful
blaze
beneath
the
rising
day,
My
name
dishonour'd,
and
my
victories
stain'd,
O'erturn'd
my
altars,
and
my
shrines
profan'd?
No;
be
it
mine
to
fan
the
Regent's
hate;
Occasion
seiz'd
commands
the
action's
fate.
'Tis
mine--this
captain,
now
my
dread
no
more,
Shall
never
shake
his
spear
on
India's
shore."
So
spake
the
Power,[105]
and
with
the
lightning's
flight
For
Afric
darted
thro'
the
fields
of
light.
His
form
divine
he
cloth'd
in
human
shape,[106]
And
rush'd
impetuous
o'er
the
rocky
cape:
In
the
dark
semblance
of
a
Moor
he
came
For
art
and
old
experience
known
to
fame:
Him
all
his
peers
with
humble
deference
heard,
And
all
Mozambique
and
its
prince
rever'd:
The
prince
in
haste
he
sought,
and
thus
express'd
His
guileful
hate
in
friendly
counsel
dress'd:
"And
to
the
regent
of
this
isle
alone
Are
these
adventurers
and
their
fraud
unknown?
Has
Fame
conceal'd
their
rapine
from
his
ear?
Nor
brought
the
groans
of
plunder'd
nations
here?
Yet
still
their
hands
the
peaceful
olive
bore
Whene'er
they
anchor'd
on
a
foreign
shore:
But
nor
their
seeming
nor
their
oaths
I
trust,
For
Afric
knows
them
bloody
and
unjust.
The
nations
sink
beneath
their
lawless
force,
And
fire
and
blood
have
mark'd
their
deadly
course.
We
too,
unless
kind
Heav'n
and
thou
prevent,
Must
fall
the
victims
of
their
dire
intent,
And,
gasping
in
the
pangs
of
death,
behold
Our
wives
led
captive,
and
our
daughters
sold.
By
stealth
they
come,
ere
morrow
dawn,
to
bring
The
healthful
bev'rage
from
the
living
spring:
Arm'd
with
his
troops
the
captain
will
appear;
For
conscious
fraud
is
ever
prone
to
fear.
To
meet
them
there
select
a
trusty
band,
And,
in
close
ambush,
take
thy
silent
stand;
There
wait,
and
sudden
on
the
heedless
foe
Rush,
and
destroy
them
ere
they
dread
the
blow.
Or
say,
should
some
escape
the
secret
snare,
Saved
by
their
fate,
their
valour,
or
their
care,
Yet
their
dread
fall
shall
celebrate
our
isle,
If
Fate
consent,
and
thou
approve
the
guile.
Give
then
a
pilot
to
their
wand'ring
fleet,
Bold
in
his
art,
and
tutor'd
in
deceit;
Whose
hand
advent'rous
shall
their
helms
misguide,
To
hostile
shores,
or
whelm
them
in
the
tide."
So
spoke
the
god,
in
semblance
of
a
sage
Renown'd
for
counsel
and
the
craft
of
age.
The
prince
with
transport
glowing
in
his
face
Approv'd,
and
caught
him
in
a
kind
embrace:
And
instant
at
the
word
his
bands
prepare
Their
bearded
darts
and
implements
of
war,
That
Lusus'
sons
might
purple
with
their
gore
The
crystal
fountain
which
they
sought
on
shore:
And,
still
regardful
of
his
dire
intent,
A
skilful
pilot
to
the
bay
he
sent,
Of
honest
mien,
yet
practised
in
deceit,
Who
far
at
distance
on
the
beach
should
wait,
And
to
the
'scaped,
if
some
should
'scape
the
snare
Should
offer
friendship
and
the
pilot's
care,
But
when
at
sea,
on
rocks
should
dash
their
pride,
And
whelm
their
lofty
vanes
beneath
the
tide.
Apollo[107]
now
had
left
his
wat'ry
bed,
And
o'er
the
mountains
of
Arabia
spread
His
rays
that
glow'd
with
gold;
when
GAMA
rose,
And
from
his
bands
a
trusty
squadron
chose:
Three
speedy
barges
brought
their
casks
to
fill
From
gurgling
fountain,
or
the
crystal
rill:
Full
arm'd
they
came,
for
brave
defence
prepar'd,
For
martial
care
is
ever
on
the
guard:
And
secret
warnings
ever
are
imprest
On
wisdom
such
as
wak'd
in
GAMA'S
breast.
And
now,
as
swiftly
springing
o'er
the
tide
Advanc'd
the
boats,
a
troop
of
Moors
they
spied;
O'er
the
pale
sands
the
sable
warriors
crowd,
And
toss
their
threat'ning
darts,
and
shout
aloud.
Yet
seeming
artless,
though
they
dar'd
the
fight,
Their
eager
hope
they
plac'd
in
artful
flight,
To
lead
brave
GAMA
where,
unseen
by
day,
In
dark-brow'd
shades
their
silent
ambush
lay.
With
scornful
gestures
o'er
the
beach
they
stride,
And
push
their
levell'd
spears
with
barb'rous
pride,
Then
fix
the
arrow
to
the
bended
bow,
And
strike
their
sounding
shields,
and
dare
the
foe.
With
gen'rous
rage
the
Lusian
race
beheld,
And
each
brave
breast
with
indignation
swell'd,
To
view
such
foes,
like
snarling
dogs,
display
Their
threat'ning
tusks,
and
brave
the
sanguine
fray:
Together
with
a
bound
they
spring
to
land,
Unknown
whose
step
first
trod
the
hostile
strand.
Thus,
when
to
gain
his
beauteous
charmer's
smile,
The
youthful
lover
dares
the
bloody
toil,[108]
Before
the
nodding
bull's
stern
front
he
stands,
He
leaps,
he
wheels,
he
shouts,
and
waves
his
hands:
The
lordly
brute
disdains
the
stripling's
rage,
His
nostrils
smoke,
and,
eager
to
engage,
His
hornèd
brows
he
levels
with
the
ground,
And
shuts
his
flaming
eyes,
and
wheeling
round
With
dreadful
bellowing
rushes
on
the
foe,
And
lays
the
boastful
gaudy
champion
low.
Thus
to
the
sight
the
sons
of
Lusus
sprung,
Nor
slow
to
fall
their
ample
vengeance
hung:
With
sudden
roar
the
carabines
resound,
And
bursting
echoes
from
the
hills
rebound;
The
lead
flies
hissing
through
the
trembling
air,
And
death's
fell
dæmons
through
the
flashes
glare.
Where,
up
the
land,
a
grove
of
palms
enclose,
And
cast
their
shadows
where
the
fountain
flows,
The
lurking
ambush
from
their
treach'rous
stand
Beheld
the
combat
burning
on
the
strand:
They
see
the
flash
with
sudden
lightnings
flare,
And
the
blue
smoke
slow
rolling
on
the
air:
They
see
their
warriors
drop,
and
starting
hear
The
ling'ring
thunders
bursting
on
their
ear.
Amaz'd,
appall'd,
the
treach'rous
ambush
fled,
And
rag'd,[109]
and
curs'd
their
birth,
and
quak'd
with
dread.
The
bands
that
vaunting
show'd
their
threaten'd
might,
With
slaughter
gor'd,
precipitate
in
flight;
Yet
oft,
though
trembling,
on
the
foe
they
turn
Their
eyes
that
red
with
lust
of
vengeance
burn:
Aghast
with
fear,
and
stern
with
desperate
rage
The
flying
war
with
dreadful
howls
they
wage,
Flints,
clods,
and
javelins
hurling
as
they
fly,
As
rage[110]
and
wild
despair
their
hands
supply:
And,
soon
dispers'd,
their
bands
attempt
no
more
To
guard
the
fountain
or
defend
the
shore:
O'er
the
wide
lawns
no
more
their
troops
appear:
Nor
sleeps
the
vengeance
of
the
victor
here;
To
teach
the
nations
what
tremendous
fate
_From
his
right
arm
on
perjur'd
vows
should
wait,
He
seized
the
time
to
awe
the
Eastern
world,
And
on
the
breach
of
faith
his
thunders
hurl'd.
From
his
black
ships
the
sudden
lightnings
blaze,
And
o'er
old
Ocean
flash
their
dreadful
rays:
White
clouds
on
clouds
inroll'd
the
smoke
ascends,
The
bursting
tumult
heaven's
wide
concave
rends:
The
bays
and
caverns
of
the
winding
shore
Repeat
the
cannon's
and
the
mortar's
roar:
The
bombs,
far-flaming,
hiss
along
the
sky,
And,
whirring
through
the
air,
the
bullets
fly;
The
wounded
air,
with
hollow
deafen'd
sound,
Groans
to
the
direful
strife,
and
trembles
round._
_Now
from
the
Moorish
town
the
sheets
of
fire,
Wide
blaze
succeeding
blaze,
to
heaven
aspire.
Black
rise
the
clouds
of
smoke,
and
by
the
gales
Borne
down,
in
streams
hang
hov'ring
o'er
the
vales;
And
slowly
floating
round
the
mountain's
head
Their
pitchy
mantle
o'er
the
landscape
spread.
Unnumber'd
sea-fowl
rising
from
the
shore,
Beat
round
in
whirls
at
every
cannon's
roar;
Where
o'er
the
smoke
the
masts'
tall
heads
appear,
Hov'ring
they
scream,
then
dart
with
sudden
fear;
On
trembling
wings
far
round
and
round
they
fly,
And
fill
with
dismal
clang
their
native
sky.
Thus
fled
in
rout
confus'd
the
treach'rous
Moors
From
field
to
field_,[111]
then,
hast'ning
to
the
shores,
Some
trust
in
boats
their
wealth
and
lives
to
save,
And,
wild
with
dread,
they
plunge
into
the
wave;
Some
spread
their
arms
to
swim,
and
some
beneath
The
whelming
billows,
struggling,
pant
for
breath,
Then
whirl'd
aloft
their
nostrils
spout
the
brine;
While
show'ring
still
from
many
a
carabine
The
leaden
hail
their
sails
and
vessels
tore,
Till,
struggling
hard,
they
reach'd
the
neighb'ring
shore:
Due
vengeance
thus
their
perfidy
repaid,
And
GAMA'S
terrors
to
the
East
display'd.
Imbrown'd
with
dust
a
beaten
pathway
shows
Where
'midst
umbrageous
palms
the
fountain
flows;
From
thence,
at
will,
they
bear
the
liquid
health;
And
now,
sole
masters
of
the
island's
wealth,
With
costly
spoils
and
eastern
robes
adorn'd,
The
joyful
victors
to
the
fleet
return'd.
With
hell's
keen
fires
still
for
revenge
athirst
The
regent
burns,
and
weens,
by
fraud
accurst,
To
strike
a
surer
yet
a
secret
blow,
And
in
one
general
death
to
whelm
the
foe.
The
promis'd
pilot
to
the
fleet
he
sends
And
deep
repentance
for
his
crime
pretends.
Sincere
the
herald
seems,
and
while
he
speaks,
The
winning
tears
steal
down
his
hoary
cheeks.
Brave
GAMA,
touch'd
with
gen'rous
woe,
believes,
And
from
his
hand
the
pilot's
hand
receives:
A
dreadful
gift!
instructed
to
decoy,
In
gulfs
to
whelm
them,
or
on
rocks
destroy.
The
valiant
chief,
impatient
of
delay,
For
India
now
resumes
the
wat'ry
way;
Bids
weigh
the
anchor
and
unfurl
the
sail,
Spread
full
the
canvas
to
the
rising
gale.
He
spoke:
and
proudly
o'er
the
foaming
tide,
Borne
on
the
wind,
the
full-wing'd
vessels
ride;
While
as
they
rode
before
the
bounding
prows
The
lovely
forms
of
sea-born
nymphs
arose.
The
while
brave
VASCO'S
unsuspecting
mind
Yet
fear'd
not
ought
the
crafty
Moor
design'd:
Much
of
the
coast
he
asks,
and
much
demands
Of
Afric's
shores
and
India's
spicy
lands.
The
crafty
Moor
by
vengeful
Bacchus
taught
Employ'd
on
deadly
guile
his
baneful
thought;
In
his
dark
mind
he
plann'd,
on
GAMA'S
head
Full
to
revenge
Mozambique
and
the
dead.
Yet
all
the
chief
demanded
he
reveal'd,
Nor
aught
of
truth,
that
truth
he
knew,
conceal'
For
thus
he
ween'd
to
gain
his
easy
faith,
And
gain'd,
betray
to
slavery
or
death.
And
now,
securely
trusting
to
destroy,
As
erst
false
Sinon[112]
snar'd
the
sons
of
Troy,
"Behold,
disclosing
from
the
sky,"
he
cries,
"Far
to
the
north,
yon
cloud-like
isle
arise:
From
ancient
times
the
natives
of
the
shore
The
blood-stain'd
image
on
the
cross
adore."
Swift
at
the
word,
the
joyful
GAMA
cried:
"For
that
fair
island
turn
the
helm
aside;
O
bring
my
vessels
where
the
Christians
dwell,
And
thy
glad
lips
my
gratitude
shall
tell."
With
sullen
joy
the
treach'rous
Moor
complied,
And
for
that
island
turn'd
the
helm
aside.
For
well
Quiloa's[113]
swarthy
race
he
knew,
Their
laws
and
faith
to
Hagar's
offspring
true;
Their
strength
in
war,
through
all
the
nations
round,
Above
Mozambique
and
her
powers
renown'd;
He
knew
what
hate
the
Christian
name
they
bore,
And
hop'd
that
hate
on
VASCO'S
bands
to
pour.
Right
to
the
land
the
faithless
pilot
steers,
Right
to
the
land
the
glad
Armada
bears;
But
heavenly
Love's
fair
queen,[114]
whose
watchful
care
Had
ever
been
their
guide,
beheld
the
snare.
A
sudden
storm
she
rais'd:
loud
howl'd
the
blast,
The
yard-arms
rattled,
and
each
groaning
mast
Bended
beneath
the
weight.
Deep
sunk
the
prows,
And
creaking
ropes
the
creaking
ropes
oppose;
In
vain
the
pilot
would
the
speed
restrain,
The
captain
shouts,
the
sailors
toil
in
vain;
Aslope
and
gliding
on
the
leeward
side,
The
bounding
vessels
cut
the
roaring
tide:
Soon
far
they
pass'd;
and
now
the
slacken'd
sail
Trembles
and
bellies
to
the
gentle
gale:
Now
many
a
league
before
the
tempest
toss'd
The
treach'rous
pilot
sees
his
purpose
cross'd:
Yet
vengeful
still,
and
still
intent
on
guile,
Behold,
he
cries,
yon
dim
emerging
isle:
There
live
the
votaries
of
Messiah's
lore
In
faithful
peace,
and
friendship
with
the
Moor.
Yet
all
was
false,
for
there
Messiah's
name,
Reviled
and
scorn'd,
was
only
known
by
fame.
The
grovelling
natives
there,
a
brutal
herd,
The
sensual
lore
of
Hagar's
son[115]
preferr'd.
With
joy
brave
GAMA
hears
the
artful
tale,
Bears
to
the
harbour,
and
bids
furl
the
sail.
Yet,
watchful
still,
fair
Love's
celestial
queen
Prevents
the
danger
with
a
hand
unseen;
Now
past
the
bar
his
vent'rous
vessel
guides,
And
safe
at
anchor
in
the
road
he
rides.
Between
the
isle
and
Ethiopia's
land
A
narrow
current
laves
each
adverse
strand;
Close
by
the
margin
where
the
green
tide
flows,
Full
to
the
bay
a
lordly
city
rose;
With
fervid
blaze
the
glowing
evening
pours
Its
purple
splendours
o'er
the
lofty
towers;
The
lofty
towers
with
milder
lustre
gleam,
And
gently
tremble
in
the
glassy
stream.
Here
reign'd
a
hoary
king
of
ancient
fame;
Mombas
the
town,
Mombas
the
island's
name.
As
when
the
pilgrim,
who
with
weary
pace
Thro'
lonely
wastes
untrod
by
human
race,
For
many
a
day
disconsolate
has
stray'd,
The
turf
his
bed,
the
wild-wood
boughs
his
shade,
O'erjoy'd
beholds
the
cheerful
seats
of
men
In
grateful
prospect
rising
on
his
ken:
So
GAMA
joy'd,
who
many
a
dreary
day
Had
traced
the
vast,
the
lonesome,
wat'ry
way,
Had
seen
new
stars,
unknown
to
Europe,
rise,
And
brav'd
the
horrors
of
the
polar
skies:
So
joy'd
his
bounding
heart
when,
proudly
rear'd,
The
splendid
city
o'er
the
wave
appear'd,
Where
Heaven's
own
lore,
he
trusted,
was
obey'd,
And
Holy
Faith
her
sacred
rites
display'd.
And
now,
swift
crowding
through
the
hornèd
bay,
The
Moorish
barges
wing'd
their
foamy
way,
To
GAMA'S
fleet
with
friendly
smiles
they
bore
The
choicest
products
of
their
cultur'd
shore.
But
there
fell
rancour
veil'd
its
serpent-head,
Though
festive
roses
o'er
the
gifts
were
spread.
For
Bacchus,
veil'd
in
human
shape,
was
here,
And
pour'd
his
counsel
in
the
sov'reign's
ear.
O
piteous
lot
of
man's
uncertain
state!
What
woes
on
Life's
unhappy
journey
wait!
When
joyful
Hope
would
grasp
its
fond
desire,
The
long-sought
transports
in
the
grasp
expire.
By
sea
what
treach'rous
calms,
what
rushing
storms,
And
death
attendant
in
a
thousand
forms!
By
land
what
strife,
what
plots
of
secret
guile,
How
many
a
wound
from
many
a
treach'rous
smile!
Oh
where
shall
man
escape
his
num'rous
foes,
And
rest
his
weary
head
in
safe
repose!

BOOK
I.
BOOK
II.
THE
ARGUMENT.
Arrival
of
the
expedition
at
Mombas.
Bacchus
plots
their
destruction
by
new
artifices.
They
are
deceived
into
the
belief
that
the
natives
are,
like
themselves,
Christians:
Bacchus
assumes
the
character
of
a
priest,
and
worships
the
god
of
the
Christians.
At
the
invitation
of
the
king
of
Mombas,
GAMA
enters
the
port,
and
reaches
the
place
intended
for
his
destruction.
Venus,
aided
by
the
Nereids,
effects
their
deliverance;
and
GAMA
sails
away,
fearing
treachery.
Venus
hastens
to
Olympus
to
seek
Jove's
aid.
Jupiter
assures
her
of
the
future
glory
of
the
Portuguese,
and
commands
Mercury
to
conduct
the
expedition
to
Melinda.
The
King
of
Melinda
asks
from
GAMA
an
historical
account
of
his
nation.
The
fervent
lustre
of
the
evening
ray
Behind
the
western
hills
now
died
away,
And
night,
ascending
from
the
dim-brow'd
east,
The
twilight
gloom
with
deeper
shades
increas'd,
When
GAMA
heard
the
creaking
of
the
oar,
And
mark'd
the
white
waves
length'ning
from
the
shore.
In
many
a
skiff
the
eager
natives
came,
Their
semblance
friendship,
but
deceit
their
aim.
And
now
by
GAMA'S
anchor'd
ships
they
ride,
And
"Hail,
illustrious
chief!"
their
leader
cried,
"Your
fame
already
these
our
regions
own,
How
your
bold
prows
from
worlds
to
us
unknown
Have
brav'd
the
horrors
of
the
southern
main,
Where
storms
and
darkness
hold
their
endless
reign,
Whose
whelmy
waves
our
westward
prows
have
barr'd
From
oldest
times,
and
ne'er
before
were
dar'd
By
boldest
leader:
earnest
to
behold
The
wondrous
hero
of
a
toil
so
bold,
To
you
the
sov'reign
of
these
islands
sends
The
holy
vows
of
peace,
and
hails
you
friends.
If
friendship
you
accept,
whate'er
kind
Heaven
In
various
bounty
to
these
shores
has
given,
Whate'er
your
wants,
your
wants
shall
here
supply,
And
safe
in
port
your
gallant
fleet
shall
lie;
Safe
from
the
dangers
of
the
faithless
tide,
And
sudden
bursting
storms,
by
you
untried;
Yours
every
bounty
of
the
fertile
shore,
Till
balmy
rest
your
wearied
strength
restore.
Or,
if
your
toils
and
ardent
hopes
demand
The
various
treasures
of
the
Indian
strand,
The
fragrant
cinnamon,
the
glowing
clove,
And
all
the
riches
of
the
spicy
grove;
Or
drugs
of
power
the
fever's
rage
to
bound,
And
give
soft
languor
to
the
smarting
wound;
Or,
if
the
splendour
of
the
diamond's
rays,
The
sapphire's
azure,
or
the
ruby's
blaze,
Invite
your
sails
to
search
the
Eastern
world,
Here
may
these
sails
in
happy
hour
be
furl'd:
For
here
the
splendid
treasures
of
the
mine,
And
richest
offspring
of
the
field
combine
To
give
each
boon
that
human
want
requires,
And
every
gem
that
lofty
pride
desires;
Then
here,
a
potent
king
your
gen'rous
friend,
Here
let
your
perilous
toils
and
wandering
searches[116]
end."
He
said:
brave
GAMA
smiles
with
heart
sincere,
And
prays
the
herald
to
the
king
to
bear
The
thanks
of
grateful
joy:
"But
now,"
he
cries,
"The
black'ning
evening
veils
the
coast
and
skies,
And
thro'
these
rocks
unknown
forbids
to
steer;
Yet,
when
the
streaks
of
milky
dawn
appear,
Edging
the
eastern
wave
with
silver
hoar,
My
ready
prows
shall
gladly
point
to
shore;
Assur'd
of
friendship,
and
a
kind
retreat,
Assur'd
and
proffer'd
by
a
king
so
great."
Yet,
mindful
still
of
what
his
hopes
had
cheer'd,
That
here
his
nation's
holy
shrines
were
rear'd,
He
asks,
if
certain,
as
the
pilot
told,
Messiah's
lore
had
flourish'd
there
of
old,
And
flourish'd
still.
The
herald
mark'd
with
joy
The
pious
wish,
and,
watchful
to
decoy,
"Messiah
here,"
he
cries,
"has
altars
more
Than
all
the
various
shrines
of
other
lore."
O'erjoy'd,
brave
VASCO
heard
the
pleasing
tale,
Yet
fear'd
that
fraud
its
viper-sting
might
veil
Beneath
the
glitter
of
a
show
so
fair.
He
half
believes
the
tale,
and
arms
against
the
snare.
With
GAMA
sail'd
a
bold
advent'rous
band,[117]
Whose
headlong
rage
had
urg'd
the
guilty
hand:
Stern
Justice
for
their
crimes
had
ask'd
their
blood,
And
pale,
in
chains
condemn'd
to
death,
they
stood;
But,
sav'd
by
GAMA
from
the
shameful
death,
The
bread
of
peace
had
seal'd
their
plighted
faith[117]
The
desolate
coast,
when
order'd,
to
explore,
And
dare
each
danger
of
the
hostile
shore:
From
this
bold
band
he
chose
the
subtlest
two,
The
port,
the
city,
and
its
strength
to
view,
To
mark
if
fraud
its
secret
head
betray'd,
Or
if
the
rites
of
Heaven
were
there
display'd.
With
costly
gifts,
as
of
their
truth
secure,
The
pledge
that
GAMA
deem'd
their
faith
was
pure.
These
two,
his
heralds,
to
the
king
he
sends:
The
faithless
Moors
depart
as
smiling
friends.
Now,
thro'
the
wave
they
cut
their
foamy
way,
Their
cheerful
songs
resounding
through
the
bay:
And
now,
on
shore
the
wond'ring
natives
greet,
And
fondly
hail
the
strangers
from
the
fleet.
The
prince
their
gifts
with
friendly
vows
receives,
And
joyful
welcome
to
the
Lusians
gives;
Where'er
they
pass,
the
joyful
tumult
bends,
And
through
the
town
the
glad
applause
attends.
But
he
whose
cheeks
with
youth
immortal
shone,
The
god
whose
wondrous
birth
two
mothers[118]
own,
Whose
rage
had
still
the
wand'ring
fleet
annoy'd,
Now
in
the
town
his
guileful
rage
employ'd.
A
Christian
priest
he
seem'd;
a
sumptuous[119]
shrine
He
rear'd,
and
tended
with
the
rites
divine:
O'er
the
fair
altar
wav'd
the
cross
on
high,
Upheld
by
angels
leaning
from
the
sky;
Descending
o'er
the
Virgin's
sacred
head
So
white,
so
pure,
the
Holy
Spirit
spread
The
dove-like
pictur'd
wings,
so
pure,
so
white;
And,
hov'ring
o'er
the
chosen
twelve,
alight
The
tongues
of
hallow'd
fire.
Amaz'd,
oppress'd,
With
sacred
awe
their
troubled
looks
confess'd
The
inspiring
godhead,
and
the
prophet's
glow,
Which
gave
each
language
from
their
lips
to
flow
Where[120]
thus
the
guileful
Power
his
magic
wrought
DE
GAMA'S
heralds
by
the
guides
are
brought:
On
bended
knees
low
to
the
earth
they
fall,
And
to
the
Lord
of
heaven
in
transport
call,
While
the
feign'd
priest
awakes
the
censer's
fire,
And
clouds
of
incense
round
the
shrine
aspire.
With
cheerful
welcome,
here
caress'd,
they
stay
Till
bright
Aurora,
messenger
of
day,
Walk'd
forth;
and
now
the
sun's
resplendent
rays,
Yet
half
emerging
o'er
the
waters,
blaze,
When
to
the
fleet
the
Moorish
oars
again
Dash
the
curl'd
waves,
and
waft
the
guileful
train:
The
lofty
decks
they
mount.
With
joy
elate,
Their
friendly
welcome
at
the
palace-gate,
The
king's
sincerity,
the
people's
care,
And
treasures
of
the
coast
the
spies
declare:
Nor
pass'd
untold
what
most
their
joys
inspir'd,
What
most
to
hear
the
valiant
chief
desir'd,
That
their
glad
eyes
had
seen
the
rites
divine,
Their[121]
country's
worship,
and
the
sacred
shrine.
The
pleasing
tale
the
joyful
GAMA
hears;
Dark
fraud
no
more
his
gen'rous
bosom
fears:
As
friends
sincere,
himself
sincere,
he
gives
The
hand
of
welcome,
and
the
Moor's
receives.
And
now,
as
conscious
of
the
destin'd
prey,
The
faithless
race,
with
smiles
and
gestures
gay,
Their
skiffs
forsaking,
GAMA'S
ships
ascend,
And
deep
to
strike
the
treach'rous
blow
attend.
On
shore
the
truthless
monarch
arms
his
bands,
And
for
the
fleet's
approach
impatient
stands;
That,
soon
as
anchor'd
in
the
port
they
rode
Brave
GAMA'S
decks
might
reek
with
Lusian
blood:
Thus
weening
to
revenge
Mozambique's
fate,
And
give
full
surfeit
to
the
Moorish
hate;
And
now
their
bowsprits
bending
to
the
bay
The
joyful
crew
the
pond'rous
anchors
weigh,
Their
shouts
the
while
resounding.
To
the
gale
With
eager
hands
they
spread
the
foremast
sail.
But
LOVE'S
fair
queen[122]
the
secret
fraud
beheld:
Swift
as
an
arrow
o'er
the
battle-field,
From
heav'n
she
darted
to
the
wat'ry
plain,
And
call'd
the
sea-born
nymphs,
a
lovely
train,
From
Nereus
sprung;
the
ready
nymphs
obey,
Proud
of
her
kindred
birth,[123]
and
own
her
sway.
She
tells
what
ruin
threats
her
fav'rite
race;
Unwonted
ardour
glows
on
every
face;
With
keen
rapidity
they
bound
away;
Dash'd
by
their
silver
limbs,
the
billows
grey
Foam
round:
Fair
Doto,
fir'd
with
rage
divine,
Darts
through
the
wave;
and
onward
o'er
the
brine
The
lovely
Nyse
and
Nerine[124]
spring
With
all
the
vehemence
and
speed
of
wing.
The
curving
billows
to
their
breasts
divide
And
give
a
yielding
passage
through
the
tide.
With
furious
speed
the
goddess
rush'd
before,
Her
beauteous
form
a
joyful
Triton
bore,
Whose
eager
face
with
glowing
rapture
fir'd,
Betray'd
the
pride
which
such
a
task
inspir'd.
And
now
arriv'd,
where
to
the
whistling
wind
The
warlike
navy's
bending
masts
reclin'd,
As
through
the
billows
rush'd
the
speedy
prows,
The
nymphs
dividing,
each
her
station
chose.
Against
the
leader's
prow,
her
lovely
breast
With
more
than
mortal
force
the
goddess
press'd;
The
ship
recoiling
trembles
on
the
tide,
The
nymphs,
in
help,
pour
round
on
every
side,
From
the
dread
bar
the
threaten'd
keels
to
save;
The
ship
bounds
up,
half
lifted
from
the
wave,
And,
trembling,
hovers
o'er
the
wat'ry
grave.
As
when
alarm'd,
to
save
the
hoarded
grain,
The
care-earn'd
store
for
winter's
dreary
reign,
So
toil,
so
tug,
so
pant,
the
lab'ring
emmet
train,[125]
So
toil'd
the
nymphs,
and
strain'd
their
panting
force
To
turn[126]
the
navy
from
its
fatal
course:
Back,
back
the
ship
recedes;
in
vain
the
crew
With
shouts
on
shouts
their
various
toils
renew;
In
vain
each
nerve,
each
nautic
art
they
strain,
And
the
rough
wind
distends
the
sail
in
vain:
Enraged,
the
sailors
see
their
labours
cross'd;
From
side
to
side
the
reeling
helm
is
toss'd:
High
on
the
poop
the
skilful
master
stands;
Sudden
he
shrieks
aloud,
and
spreads
his
hands.
A
lurking
rock
its
dreadful
rifts
betrays,
And
right
before
the
prow
its
ridge
displays;
Loud
shrieks
of
horror
from
the
yard-arms
rise,
And
a
dire
general
yell
invades
the
skies.
The
Moors
start,
fear-struck,
at
the
horrid
sound,
As
if
the
rage
of
combat
roar'd
around.
Pale
are
their
lips,
each
look
in
wild
amaze
The
horror
of
detected
guilt
betrays.
Pierc'd
by
the
glance
of
GAMA'S
awful
eyes
The
conscious
pilot
quits
the
helm
and
flies,
From
the
high
deck
he
plunges
in
the
brine;
His
mates
their
safety
to
the
waves
consign;
Dash'd
by
their
plunging
falls
on
every
side
Foams
and
boils
up
around
the
rolling
tide.
Thus[127]
the
hoarse
tenants
of
the
sylvan
lake,
A
Lycian
race
of
old,
to
flight
betake,
At
ev'ry
sound
they
dread
Latona's
hate,
And
doubled
vengeance
of
their
former
fate;
All
sudden
plunging
leave
the
margin
green,
And
but
their
heads
above
the
pool
are
seen.
So
plung'd
the
Moors,
when,
horrid
to
behold!
From
the
bar'd
rock's
dread
jaws
the
billows
roll'd,
Opening
in
instant
fate
the
fleet
to
whelm,
When
ready
VASCO
caught
the
stagg'ring
helm:
Swift
as
his
lofty
voice
resounds
aloud,
The
pond'rous
anchors
dash
the
whit'ning
flood,
And
round
his
vessel,
nodding
o'er
the
tide,
His
other
ships,
bound
by
their
anchors,
ride.
And
now
revolving
in
his
piercing
thought
These
various
scenes
with
hidden
import
fraught:
The
boastful
pilot's
self-accusing
flight,
The
former
treason
of
the
Moorish
spite;
How
headlong
to
the
rock
the
furious
wind,
The
boiling
current,
and
their
art
combin'd;
Yet,
though
the
groaning
blast
the
canvas
swell'd,
Some
wondrous
cause,
unknown,
their
speed
withheld:
Amaz'd,
with
hands
high
rais'd,
and
sparkling
eyes,
"A[128]
miracle!"
the
raptur'd
GAMA
cries,
"A
miracle!
O
hail,
thou
sacred
sign,
Thou
pledge
illustrious
of
the
care
divine!
Ah!
fraudful
malice!
how
shall
wisdom's
care
Escape
the
poison
of
thy
gilded
snare?
The
front
of
honesty,
the
saintly
show,
The
smile
of
friendship,
and
the
holy
vow
All,
all
conjoin'd
our
easy
faith
to
gain,
To
whelm
us,
shipwreck'd,
in
the
ruthless
main;
But
where
our
prudence
no
deceit
could
spy,
There,
heavenly
Guardian,
there
thy
watchful
eye
Beheld
our
danger:
still,
oh
still
prevent,
Where
human
foresight
fails,
the
dire
intent,
The
lurking
treason
of
the
smiling
foe;
And
let
our
toils,
our
days
of
length'ning
woe,
Our
weary
wand'rings
end.
If
still
for
thee,
To
spread
thy
rites,
our
toils
and
vows
agree,
On
India's
strand
thy
sacred
shrines
to
rear,
Oh
let
some
friendly
land
of
rest
appear:
If
for
thine
honour
we
these
toils
have
dar'd,
These
toils
let
India's
long-sought
shore
reward."
So
spoke
the
chief:
the
pious
accents
move
The
gentle
bosom
of
celestial
Love:
The
beauteous
Queen[129]
to
heaven
now
darts
away;
In
vain
the
weeping
nymphs
implore
her
stay:
Behind
her
now
the
morning
star
she
leaves,
And
the[130]
sixth
heaven
her
lovely
form
receives.
Her
radiant
eyes
such
living
splendours
cast,
The
sparkling
stars
were
brighten'd
as
she
pass'd;
The
frozen
pole
with
sudden
streamlets
flow'd,
And,
as
the
burning
zone,
with
fervour
glow'd.
And
now
confess'd
before
the
throne
of
Jove,
In
all
her
charms
appears
the
Queen
of
Love:
Flush'd
by
the
ardour
of
her
rapid
flight
Through
fields
of
æther
and
the
realms
of
light,
Bright
as
the
blushes
of
the
roseate
morn,
New
blooming
tints
her
glowing
cheeks
adorn;
And
all
that
pride
of
beauteous
grace
she
wore,
As[131]
when
in
Ida's
bower
she
stood
of
yore,
When
every
charm
and
every
hope
of
joy
Enraptur'd
and
allur'd
the
Trojan
boy.
Ah![132]
had
that
hunter,
whose
unhappy
fate
The
human
visage
lost
by
Dian's
hate,
Had
he
beheld
this
fairer
goddess
move
Not
hounds
had
slain
him,
but
the
fires
of
love.
Adown
her
neck,
more
white
than
virgin
snow,
Of
softest
hue
the
golden
tresses
flow;
Her
heaving
breasts
of
purer,
softer
white
Than
snow
hills
glist'ning
in
the
moon's
pale
light,
Except
where
cover'd
by
the
sash,
were
bare,
And[133]
Love,
unseen,
smil'd
soft,
and
panted
there:
Nor
less
the
zone
the
god's
fond
zeal
employs,
The
zone
awakes
the
flames
of
secret
joys.
As
ivy-tendrils
round
her
limbs
divine
Their
spreading
arms
the
young
desires
entwine:
Below
her
waist,
and
quiv'ring
on
the
gale,
Of
thinnest
texture
flows
the
silken
veil:
(Ah!
where
the
lucid
curtain
dimly
shows,
With
doubled
fires
the
roving
fancy
glows!)
The
hand
of
modesty
the
foldings
threw,
Nor
all
conceal'd,
nor
all
was
given
to
view;
Yet
her
deep
grief
her
lovely
face
betrays,
Though
on
her
cheek
the
soft
smile
falt'ring
plays.
All
heaven
was
mov'd--as
when
some
damsel
coy,
Hurt
by
the
rudeness
of
the
am'rous
boy,
Offended
chides
and
smiles;
with
angry
mien
Thus
mixt
with
smiles,
advanc'd
the
plaintive
queen;
And[134]
thus:
"O
Thunderer!
O
potent
Sire!
Shall
I
in
vain
thy
kind
regard
require?
Alas!
and
cherish
still
the
fond
deceit,
That
yet
on
me
thy
kindest
smiles
await.
Ah
heaven!
and
must
that
valour
which
I
love
Awake
the
vengeance
and
the
rage
of
Jove?
Yet
mov'd
with
pity
for
my
fav'rite
race
I
speak,
though
frowning
on
thine
awful
face,
I
mark
the
tenor
of
the
dread
decree,
That
to
thy
wrath
consigns
my
sons
and
me.
Yes!
let
stern
Bacchus
bless
thy
partial
care,
His
be
the
triumph,
and
be
mine
despair.
The
bold
advent'rous
sons
of
Tago's
clime
I
loved--alas!
that
love
is
now
their
crime:
O
happy
they,
and
prosp'rous
gales
their
fate,
Had
I
pursued
them
with
relentless
hate!
Yes!
let
my
woeful
sighs
in
vain
implore,
Yes!
let
them
perish
on
some
barb'rous
shore,
For
I
have
lov'd
them."
Here
the
swelling
sigh
And
pearly
tear-drop
rushing
in
her
eye,
As
morning
dew
hangs
trembling
on
the
rose,
Though
fond
to
speak,
her
further
speech
oppose--
Her
lips,
then
moving,
as
the
pause
of
woe
Were
now
to
give
the
voice
of
grief
to
flow;
When
kindled
by
those
charms,
whose
woes
might
move
And
melt
the
prowling
tiger's
rage
to
love.
The
thundering-god
her
weeping
sorrows
eyed,
And
sudden
threw
his
awful
state
aside:
With[135]
that
mild
look
which
stills
the
driving
storm,
When
black
roll'd
clouds
the
face
of
heaven
deform;
With
that
mild
visage
and
benignant
mien
Which
to
the
sky
restores
the
blue
serene,
Her
snowy
neck
and
glowing
cheek
he
press'd,
And
wip'd
her
tears,
and
clasp'd
her
to
his
breast;
Yet
she,
still
sighing,
dropp'd
the
trickling
tear,
As
the
chid
nursling,
mov'd
with
pride
and
fear,
Still
sighs
and
moans,
though
fondled
and
caress'd;
Till
thus
great
Jove
the
Fates'
decrees
confess'd:
"O
thou,
my
daughter,
still
belov'd
as
fair,
Vain
are
thy
fears,
thy
heroes
claim
my
care:
No
power
of
gods
could
e'er
my
heart
incline,
Like
one
fond
smile,
one
powerful
tear
of
thine.
Wide
o'er
the
eastern
shores
shalt
thou
behold
Thy
flags
far
streaming,
and
thy
thunders
roll'd;
Where
nobler
triumphs
shall
thy
nation
crown,
Than
those
of
Roman
or
of
Greek
renown.
"If
by
mine
aid
the
sapient
Greek[136]
could
brave
Th'
Ogygian
seas,
nor
sink
a
deathless
slave;[137]
If
through
th'
Illyrian
shelves
Antenor
bore,
Till
safe
he
landed
on
Timavus'
shore;
If,
by
his
fate,
the
pious
Trojan[138]
led,
Safe
through
Charybdis'[139]
barking
whirlpools
sped:
Shall
thy
bold
heroes,
by
my
care
disclaim'd,
Be
left
to
perish,
who,
to
worlds
unnam'd
By
vaunting
Rome,
pursue
their
dauntless
way?
No--soon
shalt
thou
with
ravish'd
eyes
survey,
From
stream
to
stream
their
lofty
cities
spread,
And
their
proud
turrets
rear
the
warlike
head:
The
stern-brow'd
Turk
shall
bend
the
suppliant
knee,
And
Indian
monarchs,
now
secure
and
free,
Beneath
thy
potent
monarch's
yoke
shall
bend,
And
thy
just
laws
wide
o'er
the
East
extend.
Thy
chief,
who
now
in
error's
circling
maze,
For
India's
shore
through
shelves
and
tempests
strays;
That
chief
shalt
thou
behold,
with
lordly
pride,
O'er
Neptune's
trembling
realm
triumphant
ride.
O
wondrous
fate!
when
not
a
breathing[140]
gale
Shall
curl
the
billows,
or
distend
the
sail,
The
waves
shall
boil
and
tremble,
aw'd
with
dread,
And
own
the
terror
o'er
their
empire
spread.
That
hostile
coast,
with
various
streams
supplied,
Whose
treach'rous
sons
the
fountain's
gifts
denied;
That
coast
shalt
thou
behold
his
port
supply,
Where
oft
thy
weary
fleets
in
rest
shall
lie.
Each
shore
which
weav'd
for
him
the
snares
of
death,
To
him
these
shores
shall
pledge
their
offer'd
faith;
To
him
their
haughty
lords
shall
lowly
bend,
And
yield
him
tribute
for
the
name
of
friend.
The
Red-sea
wave
shall
darken
in
the
shade
Of
thy
broad
sails,
in
frequent
pomp
display'd;
Thine
eyes
shall
see
the
golden
Ormuz'[141]
shore,
Twice
thine,
twice
conquer'd,
while
the
furious
Moor,
Amaz'd,
shall
view
his
arrows
backward[142]
driven,
Shower'd
on
his
legions
by
the
hand
of
Heaven.
Though
twice
assail'd
by
many
a
vengeful
band,
Unconquer'd
still
shall
Dio's
ramparts
stand,
Such
prowess
there
shall
raise
the
Lusian
name
That
Mars
shall
tremble
for
his
blighted
fame;
There
shall
the
Moors,
blaspheming,
sink
in
death,
And
curse
their
Prophet
with
their
parting
breath.
"Where
Goa's
warlike
ramparts
frown
on
high,
Pleas'd
shalt
thou
see
thy
Lusian
banners
fly;
The
pagan
tribes
in
chains
shall
crowd
her
gate,
While
the
sublime
shall
tower
in
regal
state,
The
fatal
scourge,
the
dread
of
all
who
dare
Against
thy
sons
to
plan
the
future
war.
Though
few
thy
troops
who
Conanour
sustain,
The
foe,
though
num'rous,
shall
assault
in
vain.
Great
Calicut,[143]
for
potent
hosts
renown'd,
By
Lisbon's
sons
assail'd
shall
strew
the
ground:
What
floods
on
floods
of
vengeful
hosts
shall
wage
On
Cochin's
walls
their
swift-repeated
rage;
In
vain:
a
Lusian
hero
shall
oppose
His
dauntless
bosom
and
disperse
the
foes,
As
high-swelled
waves,
that
thunder'd
to
the
shock,
Disperse
in
feeble
streamlets
from
the
rock.
When[144]
black'ning
broad
and
far
o'er
Actium's
tide
Augustus'
fleets
the
slave
of
love[145]
defied,
When
that
fallen
warrior
to
the
combat
led
The
bravest
troops
in
Bactrian
Scythia
bred,
With
Asian
legions,
and,
his
shameful
bane,
The
Egyptian
queen,
attendant
in
the
train;
Though
Mars
rag'd
high,
and
all
his
fury
pour'd,
Till
with
the
storm
the
boiling
surges
roar'd,
Yet
shall
thine
eyes
more
dreadful
scenes
behold,
On
burning
surges
burning
surges
roll'd,
The
sheets
of
fire
far
billowing
o'er
the
brine,
While
I
my
thunder
to
thy
sons
resign.
Thus
many
a
sea
shall
blaze,
and
many
a
shore
Resound
the
horror
of
the
combat's
roar,
While
thy
bold
prows
triumphant
ride
along
By
trembling
China
to
the
isles
unsung
By
ancient
bard,
by
ancient
chief
unknown,
Till
Ocean's
utmost
shore
thy
bondage
own.
"Thus
from
the
Ganges
to
the
Gadian[146]
strand,
From
the
most
northern
wave
to
southmost
land:
That
land
decreed
to
bear
the
injur'd
name
Of
Magalhaens,
the
Lusian
pride
and
shame;[147]
From
all
that
vast,
though
crown'd
with
heroes
old,
Who
with
the
gods
were
demi-gods
enroll'd:
From
all
that
vast
no
equal
heroes
shine
To
match
in
arms,
O
lovely
daughter,
thine."
So
spake
the
awful
ruler
of
the
skies,
And
Maia's[148]
son
swift
at
his
mandate
flies:
His
charge,
from
treason
and
Mombassa's[149]
king
The
weary
fleet
in
friendly
port
to
bring,
And,
while
in
sleep
the
brave
DE
GAMA
lay,
To
warn,
and
fair
the
shore
of
rest
display.
Fleet
through
the
yielding
air
Cyllenius[150]
glides,
As
to
the
light
the
nimble
air
divides.
The
mystic
helmet[151]
on
his
head
he
wore,
And
in
his
hand
the
fatal
rod[152]
he
bore;
That
rod
of
power[153]
to
wake
the
silent
dead,
Or
o'er
the
lids
of
care
soft
slumbers
shed.
And
now,
attended
by
the
herald
Fame,
To
fair
Melinda's
gate,
conceal'd,
he
came;
And
soon
loud
rumour
echo'd
through
the
town,
How
from
the
western
world,
from
waves
unknown,
A
noble
band
had
reach'd
the
Æthiop
shore,
Through
seas
and
dangers
never
dar'd
before:
The
godlike,
dread
attempt
their
wonder
fires,
Their
gen'rous
wonder
fond
regard
inspires,
And
all
the
city
glows
their
aid
to
give,
To
view
the
heroes,
and
their
wants
relieve.
'Twas
now
the
solemn
hour
when
midnight
reigns,
And
dimly
twinkling
o'er
the
ethereal
plains,
The
starry
host,
by
gloomy
silence
led,
O'er
earth
and
sea
a
glimm'ring
paleness
shed;
When
to
the
fleet,
which
hemm'd
with
dangers
lay,
The
silver-wing'd
Cyllenius[154]
darts
away.
Each
care
was
now
in
soft
oblivion
steep'd,
The
watch
alone
accustom'd
vigils
kept;
E'en
GAMA,
wearied
by
the
day's
alarms,
Forgets
his
cares,
reclin'd
in
slumber's
arms.
Scarce
had
he
clos'd
his
careful
eyes
in
rest,
When
Maia's
son[154]
in
vision
stood
confess'd:
And
"Fly,"
he
cried,
"O
Lusitanian,
fly;
Here
guile
and
treason
every
nerve
apply:
An
impious
king
for
thee
the
toil
prepares,
An
impious
people
weaves
a
thousand
snares:
Oh
fly
these
shores,
unfurl
the
gather'd
sail,
Lo,
Heaven,
thy
guide,
commands
the
rising
gale.
Hark,
loud
it
rustles;
see,
the
gentle
tide
Invites
thy
prows;
the
winds
thy
ling'ring
chide.
Here
such
dire
welcome
is
for
thee
prepar'd
As[155]
Diomed's
unhappy
strangers
shar'd;
His
hapless
guests
at
silent
midnight
bled,
On
their
torn
limbs
his
snorting
coursers
fed.
Oh
fly,
or
here
with
strangers'
blood
imbru'd
Busiris'
altars
thou
shalt
find
renew'd:
Amidst
his
slaughter'd
guests
his
altars
stood
Obscene
with
gore,
and
bark'd
with
human
blood:
Then
thou,
belov'd
of
Heaven,
my
counsel
hear;
Right
by
the
coast
thine
onward
journey
steer,
Till
where
the
sun
of
noon
no
shade
begets,
But
day
with
night
in
equal
tenor
sets.[156]
A
sov'reign
there,
of
gen'rous
faith
unstain'd,
With
ancient
bounty,
and
with
joy
unfeign'd
Your
glad
arrival
on
his
shore
shall
greet,
And
soothe
with
every
care
your
weary
fleet.
And
when
again
for
India's
golden
strand
Before
the
prosp'rous
gale
your
sails
expand,
A
skilful
pilot
oft
in
danger
tried,
Of
heart
sincere,
shall
prove
your
faithful
guide."
Thus
Hermes[157]
spoke;
and
as
his
flight
he
takes
Melting
in
ambient
air,
DE
GAMA
wakes.
Chill'd
with
amaze
he
stood,
when
through
the
night
With
sudden
ray
appear'd
the
bursting
light;
The
winds
loud
whizzing
through
the
cordage
sigh'd,
"Spread,
spread
the
sail!"
the
raptur'd
VASCO
cried;
"Aloft,
aloft,
this,
this
the
gale
of
heaven,
By
Heaven
our
guide,
th'
auspicious
sign
is
given;
Mine
eyes
beheld
the
messenger
divine,
'O
fly,'
he
cried,
'and
give
the
fav'ring
sign.
Here
treason
lurks.'"----Swift
as
the
captain
spake
The
mariners
spring
bounding
to
the
deck,
And
now,
with
shouts
far-echoing
o'er
the
sea,
Proud
of
their
strength
the
pond'rous
anchors
weigh.
When[158]
Heaven
again
its
guardian
care
display'd;
Above
the
wave
rose
many
a
Moorish
head,
Conceal'd
by
night
they
gently
swam
along,
And
with
their
weapons
saw'd
the
cables
strong,
That
by
the
swelling
currents
whirl'd
and
toss'd,
The
navy's
wrecks
might
strew
the
rocky
coast.
But
now
discover'd,
every
nerve
they
ply,
And
dive,
and
swift
as
frighten'd
vermin
fly.
Now
through
the
silver
waves
that
curling
rose,
And
gently
murmur'd
round
the
sloping
prows,
The
gallant
fleet
before
the
steady
wind
Sweeps
on,
and
leaves
long
foamy
tracts
behind;
While
as
they
sail
the
joyful
crew
relate
Their
wondrous
safety
from
impending
fate;
And
every
bosom
feels
how
sweet
the
joy
When,
dangers
past,
the
grateful
tongue
employ.
The
sun
had
now
his
annual
journey
run,
And
blazing
forth
another
course
begun,
When
smoothly
gliding
o'er
the
hoary
tide
Two
sloops
afar
the
watchful
master
spied;
Their
Moorish
make
the
seaman's
art
display'd;
Here
GAMA
weens
to
force
the
pilot's
aid:
One,
base
with
fear,
to
certain
shipwreck
flew;
The
keel
dash'd
on
the
shore,
escap'd
the
crew.
The
other
bravely
trusts
the
gen'rous
foe,
And
yields,
ere
slaughter
struck
the
lifted
blow,
Ere
Vulcan's
thunders
bellow'd.
Yet
again
The
captain's
prudence
and
his
wish
were
vain;
No
pilot
here
his
wand'ring
course
to
guide,
No
lip
to
tell
where
rolls
the
Indian
tide;
The
voyage
calm,
or
perilous,
or
afar,
Beneath
what
heaven,
or
which
the
guiding
star:
Yet
this
they
told,
that
by
the
neighb'ring
bay
A
potent
monarch
reign'd,
whose
pious
sway
For
truth
and
noblest
bounty
far
renown'd,
Still
with
the
stranger's
grateful
praise
was
crown'd.
O'erjoyed,
brave
GAMA
heard
the
tale,
which
seal'd
The
sacred
truth
that
Maia's[159]
son
reveal'd;
And
bids
the
pilot,
warn'd
by
Heaven
his
guide,
For
fair
Melinda[160]
turn
the
helm
aside.
'Twas
now
the
jovial
season,
when
the
morn
From
Taurus
flames,
when
Amalthea's
horn
O'er
hill
and
dale
the
rose-crown'd
Flora
pours,
And
scatters
corn
and
wine,
and
fruits
and
flowers.
Right
to
the
port
their
course
the
fleet
pursu'd,
And
the
glad
dawn
that
sacred
day[161]
renew'd,
When,
with
the
spoils
of
vanquish'd
death
adorn'd,
To
heaven
the
Victor[162]
of
the
tomb
return'd.
And
soon
Melinda's
shore
the
sailors
spy;
From
every
mast
the
purple
streamers
fly;
Rich-figur'd
tap'stry
now
supplies
the
sail.
The
gold
and
scarlet
tremble
in
the
gale;
The
standard
broad
its
brilliant
hues
bewrays,
And
floating
on
the
wind
wide-billowing
plays;
Shrill
through
the
air
the
quiv'ring
trumpet
sounds,
And
the
rough
drum
the
rousing
march
rebounds.
As
thus,
regardful
of
the
sacred
day,
The
festive
navy
cut
the
wat'ry
way,
Melinda's
sons
the
shore
in
thousands
crowd,
And,
offering
joyful
welcome,
shout
aloud:
And
truth
the
voice
inspir'd.
Unaw'd
by
fear,
With
warlike
pomp
adorn'd,
himself
sincere,
Now
in
the
port
the
gen'rous
GAMA
rides;
His
stately
vessels
range
their
pitchy
sides
Around
their
chief;
the
bowsprits
nod
the
head,
And
the
barb'd
anchors
gripe
the
harbour's
bed.
Straight
to
the
king,
as
friends
to
gen'rous
friends,
A
captive
Moor
the
valiant
GAMA
sends.
The
Lusian
fame,
the
king
already
knew,
What
gulfs
unknown
the
fleet
had
labour'd
through,
What
shelves,
what
tempests
dar'd.
His
liberal
mind
Exults
the
captain's
manly
trust
to
find;
With
that
ennobling
worth,
whose
fond
employ
Befriends
the
brave,
the
monarch
owns
his
joy,
Entreats
the
leader
and
his
weary
band
To
taste
the
dews
of
sweet
repose
on
land,
And
all
the
riches
of
his
cultur'd
fields
Obedient
to
the
nod
of
GAMA
yields.
His
care,
meanwhile,
their
present
want
attends,
And
various
fowl,
and
various
fruits
he
sends;
The
oxen
low,
the
fleecy
lambkins
bleat,
And
rural
sounds
are
echo'd
through
the
fleet.
His
gifts
with
joy
the
valiant
chief
receives,
And
gifts
in
turn,
confirming
friendship,
gives.
Here
the
proud
scarlet
darts
its
ardent
rays,
And
here
the
purple
and
the
orange
blaze;
O'er
these
profuse
the
branching
coral
spread,
The
coral[163]
wondrous
in
its
wat'ry
bed;
Soft
there
it
creeps,
in
curving
branches
thrown,
In
air
it
hardens
to
a
precious
stone.
With
these
a
herald,
on
whose
melting
tongue
The
copious
rhetoric[164]
of
Arabia
hung,
He
sends,
his
wants
and
purpose
to
reveal,
And
holy
vows
of
lasting
peace
to
seal.
The
monarch
sits
amid
his
splendid
bands,
Before
the
regal
throne
the
herald
stands,
And
thus,
as
eloquence
his
lips
inspir'd,
"O
king,"
he
cries,
"for
sacred
truth
admir'd,
Ordain'd
by
heaven
to
bend
the
stubborn
knees
Of
haughtiest
nations
to
thy
just
decrees;
Fear'd
as
thou
art,
yet
sent
by
Heaven
to
prove
That
empire's
strength
results
from
public
love:
To
thee,
O
king,
for
friendly
aid
we
come;
Nor
lawless
robbers
o'er
the
deep
we
roam:
No
lust
of
gold
could
e'er
our
breasts
inflame
To
scatter
fire
and
slaughter
where
we
came;
Nor
sword,
nor
spear
our
harmless
hands
employ
To
seize
the
careless,
or
the
weak
destroy.
At
our
most
potent
monarch's
dread
command
We
spread
the
sail
from
lordly
Europe's
strand;
Through
seas
unknown,
through
gulfs
untried
before,
We
force
our
journey
to
the
Indian
shore.
"Alas,
what
rancour
fires
the
human
breast!
By
what
stern
tribes
are
Afric's
shores
possess'd!
How
many
a
wile
they
tried,
how
many
a
snare!
Not
wisdom
sav'd
us,
'twas
the
Heaven's
own
care:
Not
harbours
only,
e'en
the
barren
sands
A
place
of
rest
denied
our
weary
bands:
From
us,
alas,
what
harm
could
prudence
fear!
From
us
so
few,
their
num'rous
friends
so
near!
While
thus,
from
shore
to
cruel
shore
long
driven,
To
thee
conducted
by
a
guide
from
heaven,
We
come,
O
monarch,
of
thy
truth
assur'd,
Of
hospitable
rites
by
Heaven
secur'd;
Such
rites[165]
as
old
Alcinous'
palace
grac'd,
When
'lorn
Ulysses
sat
his
favour'd
guest.
Nor
deem,
O
king,
that
cold
Suspicion
taints
Our
valiant
leader,
or
his
wish
prevents;
Great
is
our
monarch,
and
his
dread
command
To
our
brave
captain
interdicts
the
land
Till
Indian
earth
he
tread.
What
nobler
cause
Than
loyal
faith
can
wake
thy
fond
applause,
O
thou,
who
knowest
the
ever-pressing
weight
Of
kingly
office,[166]
and
the
cares
of
state!
And
hear,
ye
conscious
heavens,
if
GAMA'S
heart
Forget
thy
kindness,
or
from
truth
depart,
The
sacred
light
shall
perish
from
the
sun,
And
rivers
to
the
sea
shall
cease
to
run."[167]
He
spoke;
a
murmur
of
applause
succeeds,
And
each
with
wonder
own'd
the
val'rous
deeds
Of
that
bold
race,
whose
flowing
vanes
had
wav'd
Beneath
so
many
a
sky,
so
many
an
ocean
brav'd.
Nor
less
the
king
their
loyal
faith
reveres,
And
Lisboa's
lord
in
awful
state
appears,
Whose
least
command
on
farthest
shores
obey'd,
His
sovereign
grandeur
to
the
world
display'd.
Elate
with
joy,
uprose
the
royal
Moor,
And
smiling
thus,--"O
welcome
to
my
shore!
If
yet
in
you
the
fear
of
treason
dwell,
Far
from
your
thoughts
th'
ungen'rous
fear
expel:
Still
with
the
brave,
the
brave
will
honour
find,
And
equal
ardour
will
their
friendship
bind.
But
those
who
spurn'd
you,
men
alone
in
show,
Rude
as
the
bestial
herd,
no
worth
they
know;
Such
dwell
not
here:
and
since
your
laws
require
Obedience
strict,
I
yield
my
fond
desire.
Though
much
I
wish'd
your
chief
to
grace
my
board,
Fair
be
his
duty
to
his
sov'reign
Lord:
Yet
when
the
morn
walks
forth
with
dewy
feet
My
barge
shall
waft
me
to
the
warlike
fleet;
There
shall
my
longing
eyes
the
heroes
view,
And
holy
vows
the
mutual
peace
renew.
What
from
the
blust'ring
winds
and
length'ning
tide
Your
ships
have
suffer'd,
shall
be
here
supplied.
Arms
and
provisions
I
myself
will
send,
And,
great
of
skill,
a
pilot
shall
attend."
So
spoke
the
king:
and
now,
with
purpled
ray,
Beneath
the
shining
wave
the
god
of
day
Retiring,
left
the
evening
shades
to
spread;
And
to
the
fleet
the
joyful
herald
sped:
To
find
such
friends
each
breast
with
rapture
glows,
The
feast
is
kindled,
and
the
goblet
flows;
The
trembling
comet's
imitated
rays[168]
Bound
to
the
skies,
and
trail
a
sparkling
blaze:
The
vaulting
bombs
awake
their
sleeping
fire,
And,
like
the
Cyclops'
bolts,
to
heaven
aspire:
The
bombardiers
their
roaring
engines
ply,
And
earth
and
ocean
thunder
to
the
sky.
The
trump
and
fife's
shrill
clarion
far
around
The
glorious
music
of
the
fight
resound;
Nor
less
the
joy
Melinda's
sons
display,
The
sulphur
bursts
in
many
an
ardent
ray,
And
to
the
heaven
ascends,
in
whizzing
gyres,
And
ocean
flames
with
artificial
fires.
In
festive
war
the
sea
and
land
engage,
And
echoing
shouts
confess
the
joyful
rage.
So
pass'd
the
night:
and
now,
with
silv'ry
ray,
The
star
of
morning
ushers
in
the
day.
The
shadows
fly
before
the
roseate
hours,
And
the
chill
dew
hangs
glitt'ring
on
the
flowers.
The
pruning-hook
or
humble
spade
to
wield,
The
cheerful
lab'rer
hastens
to
the
field;
When
to
the
fleet,
with
many
a
sounding
oar,
The
monarch
sails;
the
natives
crowd
the
shore;
Their
various
robes
in
one
bright
splendour
join,
The
purple
blazes,
and
the
gold
stripes
shine;
Nor
as
stern
warriors
with
the
quiv'ring
lance,
Or
moon-arch'd
bow,
Melinda's
sons
advance;
Green
boughs
of
palm
with
joyful
hands
they
wave,
An
omen
of
the
meed
that
crowns
the
brave:
Fair
was
the
show
the
royal
barge
display'd,
With
many
a
flag
of
glist'ning
silk
array'd,
Whose
various
hues,
as
waving
thro'
the
bay,
Return'd
the
lustre
of
the
rising
day:
And,
onward
as
they
came,
in
sov'reign
state
The
mighty
king
amid
his
princes
sat:
His
robes
the
pomp
of
Eastern
splendour
show,
A
proud
tiara
decks
his
lordly
brow:
The
various
tissue
shines
in
every
fold,
The
silken
lustre
and
the
rays
of
gold.
His
purple
mantle
boasts
the
dye
of
Tyre,[169]
And
in
the
sunbeam
glows
with
living
fire.
A
golden
chain,
the
skilful
artist's
pride,
Hung
from
his
neck;
and
glitt'ring
by
his
side
The
dagger's
hilt
of
star-bright
diamond
shone,
The
girding
baldric[170]
burns
with
precious
stone;
And
precious
stone
in
studs
of
gold
enchas'd,
The
shaggy
velvet
of
his
buskins
grac'd:
Wide
o'er
his
head,
of
various
silks
inlaid,
A
fair
umbrella
cast
a
grateful
shade.
A
band
of
menials,
bending
o'er
the
prow,
Of
horn
wreath'd
round
the
crooked
trumpets
blow;
And
each
attendant
barge
aloud
rebounds
A
barb'rous
discord
of
rejoicing
sounds.
With
equal
pomp
the
captain
leaves
the
fleet,
Melinda's
monarch
on
the
tide
to
greet:
His
barge
nods
on
amidst
a
splendid
train,
Himself
adorn'd
in[171]
all
the
pride
of
Spain:
With
fair
embroidery
shone
his
armèd
breast,
For
polish'd
steel
supplied
the
warrior's
vest;
His
sleeves,
beneath,
were
silk
of
paly
blue,
Above,
more
loose,
the
purple's
brightest
hue
Hung
as
a
scarf
in
equal
gath'rings
roll'd,
With
golden
buttons
and
with
loops
of
gold:
Bright
in
the
sun
the
polish'd
radiance
burns,
And
the
dimm'd
eyeball
from
the
lustre
turns.
Of
crimson
satin,
dazzling
to
behold,
His
cassock
swell'd
in
many
a
curving
fold;
The
make
was
Gallic,
but
the
lively
bloom
Confess'd
the
labour
of
Venetia's
loom.
Gold
was
his
sword,
and
warlike
trousers
lac'd
With
thongs
of
gold
his
manly
legs
embrac'd.
With
graceful
mien
his
cap
aslant
was
turn'd.
The
velvet
cap
a
nodding
plume
adorn'd.
His
noble
aspect,
and
the
purple's
ray,
Amidst
his
train
the
gallant
chief
bewray.
The
various
vestments
of
the
warrior
train,
Like
flowers
of
various
colours
on
the
plain,
Attract
the
pleas'd
beholder's
wond'ring
eye,
And
with
the
splendour
of
the
rainbow
vie.
Now
GAMA'S
bands
the
quiv'ring
trumpet
blow,
Thick
o'er
the
wave
the
crowding
barges
row,
The
Moorish
flags
the
curling
waters
sweep,
The
Lusian
mortars
thunder
o'er
the
deep;
Again
the
fiery
roar
heaven's
concave
tears,
The
Moors
astonished
stop
their
wounded
ears;
Again
loud
thunders
rattle
o'er
the
bay,
And
clouds
of
smoke
wide-rolling
blot
the
day;
The
captain's
barge
the
gen'rous
king
ascends,
His
arms
the
chief
enfold,
the
captain
bends,
(A
rev'rence
to
the
scepter'd
grandeur
due):
In
silent
awe
the
monarch's
wond'ring
view
Is
fix'd
on
VASCO'S
noble
mien;[172]
the
while
His
thoughts
with
wonder
weigh
the
hero's
toil.
Esteem
and
friendship
with
his
wonder
rise,
And
free
to
GAMA
all
his
kingdom
lies.
Though
never
son
of
Lusus'
race
before
Had
met
his
eye,
or
trod
Melinda's
shore
To
him
familiar
was
the
mighty
name,
And
much
his
talk
extols
the
Lusian
fame;
How
through
the
vast
of
Afric's
wildest
bound
Their
deathless
feats
in
gallant
arms
resound;
When
that
fair
land
where
Hesper's
offspring
reign'd,
Their
valour's
prize
the
Lusian
youth
obtain'd.
Much
still
he
talk'd,
enraptur'd
of
the
theme,
Though
but
the
faint
vibrations
of
their
fame
To
him
had
echo'd.
Pleas'd
his
warmth
to
view,
Convinc'd
his
promise
and
his
heart
were
true,
The
illustrious
GAMA
thus
his
soul
express'd
And
own'd
the
joy
that
labour'd
in
his
breast:
"Oh
thou,
benign,
of
all
the
tribes
alone,
Who
feel
the
rigour
of
the
burning
zone,
Whose
piety,
with
Mercy's
gentle
eye
Beholds
our
wants,
and
gives
the
wish'd
supply,
Our
navy
driven
from
many
a
barb'rous
coast,
On
many
a
tempest-harrow'd
ocean
toss'd,
At
last
with
thee
a
kindly
refuge
finds,
Safe
from
the
fury
of
the
howling
winds.
O
gen'rous
king,
may
He
whose
mandate
rolls
The
circling
heavens,
and
human
pride
controls,
May
the
Great
Spirit
to
thy
breast
return
That
needful
aid,
bestow'd
on
us
forlorn!
And
while
yon
sun
emits
his
rays
divine,
And
while
the
stars
in
midnight
azure
shine,
Where'er
my
sails
are
stretch'd
the
world
around,
Thy
praise
shall
brighten,
and
thy
name
resound."
He
spoke;
the
painted
barges
swept
the
flood,
Where,
proudly
gay,
the
anchor'd
navy
rode;
Earnest
the
king
the
lordly
fleet
surveys;
The
mortars
thunder,
and
the
trumpets
raise
Their
martial
sounds
Melinda's
sons
to
greet,
Melinda's
sons
with
timbrels
hail
the
fleet.
And
now,
no
more
the
sulphury
tempest
roars,
The
boatmen
leaning
on
the
rested
oars
Breathe
short;
the
barges
now
at
anchor
moor'd,
The
king,
while
silence
listen'd
round,
implor'd
The
glories
of
the
Lusian
wars
to
hear,
Whose
faintest
echoes
long
had
pleas'd
his
ear:
Their
various
triumphs
on
the
Afric
shore
O'er
those
who
hold
the
son
of
Hagar's[173]
lore.
Fond
he
demands,
and
now
demands
again
Their
various
triumphs
on
the
western
main
Again,
ere
readiest
answer
found
a
place,
He
asks
the
story
of
the
Lusian
race;
What
god
was
founder
of
the
mighty
line,
Beneath
what
heaven
their
land,
what
shores
adjoin;
And
what
their
climate,
where
the
sinking
day
Gives
the
last
glimpse
of
twilight's
silv'ry
ray.
"But
most,
O
chief,"
the
zealous
monarch
cries,
"What
raging
seas
you
brav'd,
what
low'ring
skies;
What
tribes,
what
rites
you
saw;
what
savage
hate
On
our
rude
Afric
prov'd
your
hapless
fate:
Oh
tell,
for
lo,
the
chilly
dawning
star
Yet
rides
before
the
morning's
purple
car;
And
o'er
the
wave
the
sun's
bold
coursers
raise
Their
flaming
fronts,
and
give
the
opening
blaze;
Soft
on
the
glassy
wave
the
zephyrs
sleep,
And
the
still
billows
holy
silence
keep.
Nor
less
are
we,
undaunted
chief,
prepar'd
To
hear
thy
nation's
gallant
deeds
declar'd;
Nor
think,
tho'
scorch'd
beneath
the
car
of
day,
Our
minds
too
dull
the
debt
of
praise
to
pay;
Melinda's
sons
the
test
of
greatness
know,
And
on
the
Lusian
race
the
palm
bestow.
"If
Titan's
giant
brood
with
impious
arms
Shook
high
Olympus'
brow
with
rude
alarms;
If
Theseus
and
Pirithoüs
dar'd
invade
The
dismal
horrors
of
the
Stygian
shade,
Nor
less
your
glory,
nor
your
boldness
less
That
thus
exploring
Neptune's
last
recess
Contemns
his
waves
and
tempests.
If
the
thirst
To
live
in
fame,
though
famed
for
deeds
accurs'd,
Could
urge
the
caitiff,
who
to
win
a
name
Gave
Dian's
temple
to
the
wasting
flame:[174]
If
such
the
ardour
to
attain
renown,
How
bright
the
lustre
of
the
hero's
crown,
Whose
deeds
of
fair
emprize
his
honours
raise,
And
bind
his
brows,
like
thine,
with
deathless
bays!"

assassination.
Don

the
weak
and
effeminate
Ferdinand.
His

torn
from

reign.
Oh
now,
Calliope,
thy
potent
aid!
What
to
the
king
th'
illustrious
GAMA
said
Clothe
in
immortal
verse.
With
sacred
fire
My
breast,
If
e'er
it
loved
thy
lore,
inspire:
So
may
the
patron[175]
of
the
healing
art,
The
god
of
day
to
thee
consign
his
heart;
From
thee,
the
mother
of
his
darling
son,[176]
May
never
wand'ring
thought
to
Daphne
run:
May
never
Clytia,
nor
Leucothoë's
pride
Henceforth
with
thee
his
changeful
love
divide.
Then
aid,
O
fairest
nymph,
my
fond
desire,
And
give
my
verse
the
Lusian
warlike
fire:
Fir'd
by
the
song,
the
list'ning
world
shall
know
That
Aganippe's
streams
from
Tagus
flow.
Oh,
let
no
more
the
flowers
of
Pindus
shine
On
thy
fair
breast,
or
round
thy
temples
twine:
On
Tago's
banks
a
richer
chaplet
blows,
And
with
the
tuneful
god
my
bosom
glows:
I
feel,
I
feel
the
mighty
power
infuse,
And
bathe
my
spirit
in
Aonian[177]
dews!
Now
silence
woo'd
the
illustrious
chief's
reply,
And
keen
attention
watch'd
on
every
eye;
When
slowly
turning
with
a
modest
grace,
The
noble
VASCO
rais'd
his
manly
face;
O
mighty
king
(he
cries),
at
thy[178]
command
The
martial
story
of
my
native
land
I
tell;
but
more
my
doubtful
heart
had
joy'd
Had
other
wars
my
praiseful
lips
employ'd.
When
men
the
honours
of
their
race
commend,
The
doubts
of
strangers
on
the
tale
attend:
Yet,
though
reluctance
falter
on
my
tongue,
Though
day
would
fail
a
narrative
so
long,
Yet,
well
assur'd
no
fiction's
glare
can
raise,
Or
give
my
country's
fame
a
brighter
praise;
Though
less,
far
less,
whate'er
my
lips
can
say,
Than
truth
must
give
it,
I
thy
will
obey.
Between
that
zone
where
endless
winter
reigns
And
that
where
flaming
heat
consumes
the
plains;
Array'd
in
green,
beneath
indulgent
skies,
The
queen
of
arts
and
arms,
fair
Europe
lies.
Around
her
northern
and
her
western
shores,
Throng'd
with
the
finny
race
old
ocean
roars;
The
midland
sea,[179]
where
tide
ne'er
swell'd
the
waves,
Her
richest
lawns,
the
southern
border,
laves.
Against
the
rising
morn,
the
northmost
bound
The
whirling
Tanais[180]
parts
from
Asian
ground,
As
tumbling
from
the
Scythian
mountains
cold
Their
crooked
way
the
rapid
waters
hold
To
dull
Mæotis'[181]
lake.
Her
eastern
line
More
to
the
south,
the
Phrygian
waves
confine:
Those
waves,
which,
black
with
many
a
navy,
bore
The
Grecian
heroes
to
the
Dardan
shore;
Where
now
the
seaman,
rapt
in
mournful
joy,
Explores
in
vain
the
sad
remains
of
Troy.
Wide
to
the
north
beneath
the
pole
she
spreads;
Here
piles
of
mountains
rear
their
rugged
heads,
Here
winds
on
winds
in
endless
tempests
roll,
The
valleys
sigh,
the
length'ning
echoes
howl.
On
the
rude
cliffs,
with
frosty
spangles
grey,
Weak
as
the
twilight,
gleams
the
solar
ray;
Each
mountain's
breast
with
snows
eternal
shines,
The
streams
and
seas
eternal
frost
confines.
Here
dwelt
the
num'rous
Scythian
tribes
of
old,
A
dreadful
race!
by
victor
ne'er
controll'd,
Whose
pride
maintain'd
that
theirs
the
sacred
earth,
Not
that
of
Nile,
which
first
gave
man
his
birth.
Here
dismal
Lapland
spreads
a
dreary
wild,
Here
Norway's
wastes,
where
harvest
never
smil'd,
Whose
groves
of
fir
in
gloomy
horror
frown,
Nod
o'er
the
rocks,
and
to
the
tempest
groan.
Here
Scandia's
clime
her
rugged
shores
extends,
And,
far
projected,
through
the
ocean
bends;
Whose
sons'
dread
footsteps
yet
Ausonia[182]
wears,
And
yet
proud
Rome
in
mournful
ruin
bears.
When
summer
bursts
stern
winter's
icy
chain,
Here
the
bold
Swede,
the
Prussian,
and
the
Dane
Hoist
the
white
sail
and
plough
the
foamy
way,
Cheer'd
by
whole
months
of
one
continual
day:
Between
these
shores
and
Tanais'[183]
rushing
tide
Livonia's
sons
and
Russia's
hordes
reside.
Stern
as
their
clime
the
tribes,
whose
sires
of
yore
The
name,
far
dreaded,
of
Sarmatians
bore.
Where,
fam'd
of
old,
th'
Hercynian[184]
forest
lower'd,
Oft
seen
in
arms
the
Polish
troops
are
pour'd
Wide
foraging
the
downs.
The
Saxon
race,
The
Hungar
dext'rous
in
the
wild-boar
chase,
The
various
nations
whom
the
Rhine's
cold
wave
The
Elbe,
Amasis,
and
the
Danube
lave,
Of
various
tongues,
for
various
princes
known,
Their
mighty
lord
the
German
emperor
own.
Between
the
Danube
and
the
lucid
tide
Where
hapless
Helle
left
her
name,[185]
and
died:
The
dreadful
god
of
battles'
kindred
race,
Degenerate
now,
possess
the
hills
of
Thrace.
Mount
Hæmus[186]
here,
and
Rhodope
renown'd,
And
proud
Byzantium,[187]
long
with
empire
crown'd;
Their
ancient
pride,
their
ancient
virtue
fled,
Low
to
the
Turk
now
bend
the
servile
head.
Here
spread
the
fields
of
warlike
Macedon,
And
here
those
happy
lands
where
genius
shone
In
all
the
arts,
in
all
the
Muses'
charms,
In
all
the
pride
of
elegance
and
arms,
Which
to
the
heavens
resounded
Grecia's
name,
And
left
in
every
age
a
deathless
fame.
The
stern
Dalmatians
till
the
neighb'ring
ground;
And
where
Antenor
anchor'd
in
the
sound
Proud
Venice,
as
a
queen,
majestic
towers,
And
o'er
the
trembling
waves
her
thunder
pours.
For
learning
glorious,
glorious
for
the
sword,
While
Rome's
proud
monarch
reign'd
the
world's
dread
lord,
Here
Italy
her
beauteous
landscapes
shows;
Around
her
sides
his
arms
old
ocean
throws;
The
dashing
waves
the
ramparts
aid
supply;
The
hoary
Alps
high
tow'ring
to
the
sky,
From
shore
to
shore
a
rugged
barrier
spread,
And
lower
destruction
on
the
hostile
tread.
But
now
no
more
her
hostile
spirit
burns,
There
now
the
saint,
in
humble
vespers
mourns
To
Heaven
more
grateful
than
the
pride
of
war,
And
all
the
triumphs
of
the
victor's
car.
Onward
fair
Gallia
opens
to
the
view
Her
groves
of
olive,
and
her
vineyards
blue:
Wide
spread
her
harvests
o'er
the
scenes
renown'd,
Where
Julius[188]
proudly
strode
with
laurel
crown'd.
Here
Seine,
how
fair
when
glist'ning
to
the
moon!
Rolls
his
white
wave,
and
here
the
cold
Garoon;
Here
the
deep
Rhine
the
flow'ry
margin
laves,
And
here
the
rapid
Rhone
impervious
raves.
Here
the
gruff
mountains,
faithless
to
the
vows
Of
lost
Pyrene[189]
rear
their
cloudy
brows;
Whence,
when
of
old
the
flames
their
woods
devour'd,
Streams
of
red
gold
and
melted
silver
pour'd.
And
now,
as
head
of
all
the
lordly
train
Of
Europe's
realms,
appears
illustrious
Spain.
Alas,
what
various
fortunes
has
she
known!
Yet
ever
did
her
sons
her
wrongs
atone;
Short
was
the
triumph
of
her
haughty
foes,
And
still
with
fairer
bloom
her
honours
rose.
Where,
lock'd
with
land,
the
struggling
currents
boil
Fam'd
for
the
godlike
Theban's
latest
toil,[190]
Against
one
coast
the
Punic
strand
extends,
Around
her
breast
the
midland
ocean
bends,
Around
her
shores
two
various
oceans
swell,
And
various
nations
in
her
bosom
dwell.
Such
deeds
of
valour
dignify
their
names,
Each
the
imperial
right
of
honour
claims.
Proud
Aragon,
who
twice
her
standard
rear'd
In
conquer'd
Naples;
and
for
art
rever'd,
Galicia's
prudent
sons;
the
fierce
Navarre,
And
he
far
dreaded
in
the
Moorish
war,
The
bold
Asturian;
nor
Sevilia's
race,
Nor
thine,
Granada,
claim
the
second
place.
Here
too
the
heroes
who
command
the
plain
By
Betis[191]
water'd;
here
the
pride
of
Spain,
The
brave
Castilian
pauses
o'er
his
sword,
His
country's
dread
deliverer
and
lord.
Proud
o'er
the
rest,
with
splendid
wealth
array'd,
As
crown
to
this
wide
empire,
Europe's
head,
Fair
Lusitania
smiles,
the
western
bound,
Whose
verdant
breast
the
rolling
waves
surround,
Where
gentle
evening
pours
her
lambent
ray,
The
last
pale
gleaming
of
departing
day;
This,
this,
O
mighty
king,
the
sacred
earth,
This
the
loved
parent-soil
that
gave
me
birth.
And
oh,
would
bounteous
Heaven
my
prayer
regard,
And
fair
success
my
perilous
toils
reward,
May
that
dear
land
my
latest
breath
receive,
And
give
my
weary
bones
a
peaceful
grave.
Sublime
the
honours
of
my
native
land,
And
high
in
Heaven's
regard
her
heroes
stand;
By
Heaven's
decree
'twas
theirs
the
first
to
quell
The
Moorish
tyrants,
and
from
Spain
expel;
Nor
could
their
burning
wilds
conceal
their
flight,
Their
burning
wilds
confess'd
the
Lusian
might.
From
Lusus
famed,
whose
honour'd
name
we
bear,
(The
son
of
Bacchus
or
the
bold
compeer),
The
glorious
name
of
Lusitania
rose,
A
name
tremendous
to
the
Roman
foes,
When
her
bold
troops
the
valiant
shepherd[192]
led,
And
foul
with
rout
the
Roman
eagles
fled;
When
haughty
Rome
achiev'd
the
treach'rous
blow,
That
own'd
her
terror
of
the
matchless
foe.[193]
But,
when
no
more
her
Viriatus
fought,
Age
after
age
her
deeper
thraldom
brought;
Her
broken
sons
by
ruthless
tyrants
spurn'd,
Her
vineyards
languish'd,
and
her
pastures
mourn'd;
Till
time
revolving
rais'd
her
drooping
head,
And
o'er
the
wond'ring
world
her
conquests
spread.
Thus
rose
her
power:
the
lands
of
lordly
Spain
Were
now
the
brave
Alonzo's
wide
domain;
Great
were
his
honours
in
the
bloody
fight,
And
Fame
proclaim'd
him
champion
of
the
right.
And
oft
the
groaning
Saracen's[194]
proud
crest
And
shatter'd
mail
his
awful
force
confess'd.
From
Calpe's
summits
to
the
Caspian
shore
Loud-tongued
renown
his
godlike
actions
bore.
And
many
a
chief
from
distant
regions[195]
came
To
share
the
laurels
of
Alonzo's
fame;
Yet,
more
for
holy
Faith's
unspotted
cause
Their
spears
they
wielded,
than
for
Fame's
applause.
Great
were
the
deeds
their
thund'ring
arms
display'd,
And
still
their
foremost
swords
the
battle
sway'd.
And
now
to
honour
with
distinguish'd
meed
Each
hero's
worth
the
gen'rous
king
decreed.
The
first
and
bravest
of
the
foreign
bands
Hungaria's
younger
son,
brave
Henry[196]
stands.
To
him
are
given
the
fields
where
Tagus
flows,
And
the
glad
king
his
daughter's
hand
bestows;
The
fair
Teresa
shines
his
blooming
bride,
And
owns
her
father's
love,
and
Henry's
pride.
With
her,
besides,
the
sire
confirms
in
dower
Whate'er
his
sword
might
rescue
from
the
Moor;
And
soon
on
Hagar's
race[197]
the
hero
pours
His
warlike
fury--soon
the
vanquish'd
Moors
To
him
far
round
the
neighb'ring
lands
resign,
And
Heaven
rewards
him
with
a
glorious
line.
To
him
is
born,
Heaven's
gift,
a
gallant
son,
The
glorious
founder
of
the
Lusian
throne.
Nor
Spain's
wide
lands
alone
his
deeds
attest,
Deliver'd
Judah
Henry's
might[198]
confess'd
On
Jordan's
bank
the
victor-hero
strode,
Whose
hallow'd
waters
bath'd
the
Saviour-God;
And
Salem's[199]
gate
her
open
folds
display'd,
When
Godfrey[200]
conquer'd
by
the
hero's
aid.
But
now
no
more
in
tented
fields
oppos'd,
By
Tagus'
stream
his
honour'd
age
he
clos'd;
Yet
still
his
dauntless
worth,
his
virtue
lived,
And
all
the
father
in
the
son
survived.
And
soon
his
worth
was
prov'd,
the
parent
dame
Avow'd
a
second
hymeneal
flame.[201]
The
low-born
spouse
assumes
the
monarch's
place,
And
from
the
throne
expels
the
orphan
race.
But
young
Alphonso,
like
his
sires
of
yore
(His
grandsire's
virtues,
as
his
name,
he
bore),
Arms
for
the
fight,
his
ravish'd
throne
to
win,
And
the
lac'd
helmet
grasps
his
beardless
chin.
Her
fiercest
firebrands
Civil
Discord
wav'd,
Before
her
troops
the
lustful
mother
rav'd;
Lost
to
maternal
love,
and
lost
to
shame,
Unaw'd
she
saw
Heaven's
awful
vengeance
flame;
The
brother's
sword
the
brother's
bosom
tore,
And
sad
Guimaria's[202]
meadows
blush'd
with
gore;
With
Lusian
gore
the
peasant's
cot
was
stain'd,
And
kindred
blood
the
sacred
shrine
profan'd.
Here,
cruel
Progne,
here,
O
Jason's
wife,
Yet
reeking
with
your
children's
purple
life,
Here
glut
your
eyes
with
deeper
guilt
than
yours;
Here
fiercer
rage
her
fiercer
rancour
pours.
Your
crime
was
vengeance
on
the
faithless
sires,
But
here
ambition
with
foul
lust
conspires.
'Twas
rage
of
love,
O
Scylla,
urged
the
knife[203]
That
robb'd
thy
father
of
his
fated
life;
Here
grosser
rage
the
mother's
breast
inflames,
And
at
her
guiltless
son
the
vengeance
aims,
But
aims
in
vain;
her
slaughter'd
forces
yield,
And
the
brave
youth
rides
victor
o'er
the
field.
No
more
his
subjects
lift
the
thirsty
sword,
And
the
glad
realm
proclaims
the
youthful
lord.
But
ah,
how
wild
the
noblest
tempers
run!
His
filial
duty
now
forsakes
the
son;
Secluded
from
the
day,
in
clanking
chains
His
rage
the
parent's
agèd
limbs
constrains.
Heaven
frown'd--Dark
vengeance
lowering
on
his
brows,
And
sheath'd
in
brass,
the
proud
Castilian
rose,
Resolv'd
the
rigour
to
his
daughter
shown
The
battle
should
avenge,
and
blood
atone.
A
numerous
host
against
the
prince
he
sped,
The
valiant
prince
his
little
army
led:
Dire
was
the
shock;
the
deep-riven
helms
resound,
And
foes
with
foes
lie
grappling
on
the
ground.
Yet,
though
around
the
stripling's
sacred
head
By
angel
hands
etherial
shields
were
spread;
Though
glorious
triumph
on
his
valour
smiled,
Soon
on
his
van
the
baffled
foe
recoil'd:
With
bands
more
num'rous
to
the
field
he
came,
His
proud
heart
burning
with
the
rage
of
shame.
And
now
in
turn
Guimaria's[204]
lofty
wall,
That
saw
his
triumph,
saw
the
hero
fall;
Within
the
town
immured,
distress'd
he
lay,
To
stern
Castilia's
sword
a
certain
prey.
When
now
the
guardian
of
his
infant
years,
The
valiant
Egas,
as
a
god
appears;
To
proud
Castile
the
suppliant
noble
bows,
And
faithful
homage
for
his
prince
he
vows.
The
proud
Castile
accepts
his
honour'd
faith,
And
peace
succeeds
the
dreadful
scenes
of
death.
Yet
well,
alas,
the
generous
Egas
knew
His
high-soul'd
prince
to
man
would
never
sue:
Would
never
stoop
to
brook
the
servile
stain,
To
hold
a
borrow'd,
a
dependent
reign.
And
now
with
gloomy
aspect
rose
the
day,
Decreed
the
plighted
servile
rights
to
pay;
When
Egas,
to
redeem
his
faith's
disgrace,
Devotes
himself,
his
spouse,
and
infant
race.
In
gowns
of
white,
as
sentenced
felons
clad,
When
to
the
stake
the
sons
of
guilt
are
led,
With
feet
unshod
they
slowly
moved
along,
And
from
their
necks
the
knotted
halters
hung.
"And
now,
O
king,"
the
kneeling
Egas
cries,
"Behold
my
perjured
honour's
sacrifice:
If
such
mean
victims
can
atone
thine
ire,
Here
let
my
wife,
my
babes,
myself
expire.
If
gen'rous
bosoms
such
revenge
can
take,
Here
let
them
perish
for
the
father's
sake:
The
guilty
tongue,
the
guilty
hands
are
these,
Nor
let
a
common
death
thy
wrath
appease;
For
us
let
all
the
rage
of
torture
burn,
But
to
my
prince,
thy
son,
in
friendship
turn."
He
spoke,
and
bow'd
his
prostrate
body
low,
As
one
who
waits
the
lifted
sabre's
blow;
When
o'er
the
block
his
languid
arms
are
spread,
And
death,
foretasted,
whelms
the
heart
with
dread:
So
great
a
leader
thus
in
humbled
state,
So
firm
his
loyalty,
his
zeal
so
great,
The
brave
Alonzo's
kindled
ire
subdu'd,
And,
lost
in
silent
joy,
the
monarch
stood;
Then
gave
the
hand,
and
sheath'd
the
hostile
sword,
And,
to
such
honour
honour'd
peace[205]
restor'd.
Oh
Lusian
faith!
oh
zeal
beyond
compare!
What
greater
danger
could
the
Persian
dare,
Whose
prince
in
tears,
to
view
his
mangled
woe,
Forgot
the
joy
for
Babylon's[206]
o'erthrow.
And
now
the
youthful
hero
shines
in
arms,
The
banks
of
Tagus
echo
war's
alarms:
O'er
Ourique's
wide
campaign
his
ensigns
wave,
And
the
proud
Saracen
to
combat
brave.
Though
prudence
might
arraign
his
fiery
rage
That
dar'd
with
one,
each
hundred
spears
engage,
In
Heaven's
protecting
care
his
courage
lies,
And
Heaven,
his
friend,
superior
force
supplies.
Five
Moorish
kings
against
him
march
along,
Ismar
the
noblest
of
the
armèd
throng;
Yet
each
brave
monarch
claim'd
the
soldier's
name,
And
far
o'er
many
a
land
was
known
to
fame.
In
all
the
beauteous
glow
of
blooming
years[207]
Beside
each
king
a
warrior
nymph
appears;
Each
with
her
sword
her
valiant
lover
guards,
With
smiles
inspires
him,
and
with
smiles
rewards.
Such
was
the
valour
of
the
beauteous
maid,[208]
Whose
warlike
arm
proud
Ilion's[209]
fate
delay'd.
Such
in
the
field
the
virgin
warriors[210]
shone,
Who
drank
the
limpid
wave
of
Thermodon.[211]
'Twas
morn's
still
hour,
before
the
dawning
grey
The
stars'
bright
twinkling
radiance
died
away,
When
lo,
resplendent
in
the
heaven
serene,
High
o'er
the
prince
the
sacred
cross
was
seen;
The
godlike
prince
with
Faith's
warm
glow
inflam'd,
"Oh,
not
to
me,
my
bounteous
God!"
exclaim'd,
"Oh,
not
to
me,
who
well
thy
grandeur
know,
But
to
the
pagan
herd
thy
wonders
show."
The
Lusian
host,
enraptur'd,
mark'd
the
sign
That
witness'd
to
their
chief
the
aid
divine:
Right
on
the
foe
they
shake
the
beamy
lance,
And
with
firm
strides,
and
heaving
breasts,
advance;
Then
burst
the
silence,
"Hail,
O
king!"
they
cry;
"Our
king,
our
king!"
the
echoing
dales
reply:
Fir'd
at
the
sound,
with
fiercer
ardour
glows
The
Heaven-made
monarch;
on
the
wareless
foes
Rushing,
he
speeds
his
ardent
bands
along:
So,
when
the
chase
excites
the
rustic
throng,
Rous'd
to
fierce
madness
by
their
mingled
cries,
On
the
wild
bull
the
red-eyed
mastiff
flies.
The
stern-brow'd
tyrant
roars
and
tears
the
ground
His
watchful
horns
portend
the
deathful
wound.
The
nimble
mastiff
springing
on
the
foe,
Avoids
the
furious
sharpness
of
the
blow;
Now
by
the
neck,
now
by
the
gory
sides
Hangs
fierce,
and
all
his
bellowing
rage
derides:
In
vain
his
eye-balls
burn
with
living
fire,
In
vain
his
nostrils
clouds
of
smoke
respire,
His
gorge
torn
down,
down
falls
the
furious
prize
With
hollow
thund'ring
sound,
and
raging
dies:[212]
Thus,
on
the
Moors
the
hero
rush'd
along,
Th'
astonish'd
Moors
in
wild
confusion
throng;
They
snatch
their
arms,
the
hasty
trumpet
sounds,
With
horrid
yell
the
dread
alarm
rebounds;
The
warlike
tumult
maddens
o'er
the
plain,
As
when
the
flame
devours
the
bearded
grain:
The
nightly
flames
the
whistling
winds
inspire,
Fierce
through
the
braky
thicket
pours
the
fire:
Rous'd
by
the
crackling
of
the
mounting
blaze
From
sleep
the
shepherds
start
in
wild
amaze;
They
snatch
their
clothes
with
many
a
woeful
cry,
And,
scatter'd,
devious
to
the
mountains
fly:
Such
sudden
dread
the
trembling
Moors
alarms,
Wild
and
confused,
they
snatch
the
nearest
arms;
Yet
flight
they
scorn,
and,
eager
to
engage,
They
spur
their
foamy
steeds,
and
trust
their
furious
rage:
Amidst
the
horror
of
the
headlong
shock,
With
foot
unshaken
as
the
living
rock
Stands
the
bold
Lusian
firm;
the
purple
wounds
Gush
horrible;
deep,
groaning
rage
resounds;
Reeking
behind
the
Moorish
backs
appear
The
shining
point
of
many
a
Lusian
spear;
The
mailcoats,
hauberks,[213]
and
the
harness
steel'd,
Bruis'd,
hack'd,
and
torn,
lie
scatter'd
o'er
the
field;
Beneath
the
Lusian
sweepy
force
o'erthrown,
Crush'd
by
their
batter'd
mails
the
wounded
groan;
Burning
with
thirst
they
draw
their
panting
breath,
And
curse
their
prophet[214]
as
they
writhe
in
death.
Arms
sever'd
from
the
trunks
still
grasp
the
steel,[215]
Heads
gasping
roll;
the
fighting
squadrons
reel;
Fainty
and
weak
with
languid
arms
they
close,
And
stagg'ring,
grapple
with
the
stagg'ring
foes.
So,
when
an
oak
falls
headlong
on
the
lake,
The
troubled
waters
slowly
settling
shake:
So
faints
the
languid
combat
on
the
plain,
And
settling,
staggers
o'er
the
heaps
of
slain.
Again
the
Lusian
fury
wakes
its
fires,
The
terror
of
the
Moors
new
strength
inspires:
The
scatter'd
few
in
wild
confusion
fly,
And
total
rout
resounds
the
yelling
cry.
Defil'd
with
one
wide
sheet
of
reeking
gore,
The
verdure
of
the
lawn
appears
no
more:
In
bubbling
streams
the
lazy
currents
run,
And
shoot
red
flames
beneath
the
evening
sun.
With
spoils
enrich'd,
with
glorious
trophies[216]
crown'd,
The
Heaven-made
sov'reign
on
the
battle
ground
Three
days
encamp'd,
to
rest
his
weary
train,
Whose
dauntless
valour
drove
the
Moors
from
Spain.
And
now,
in
honour
of
the
glorious
day,
When
five
proud
monarchs
fell,
his
vanquish'd
prey,
On
his
broad
buckler,
unadorn'd
before,
Placed
as
a
cross,
five
azure
shields
he
wore,
In
grateful
memory
of
the
heav'nly
sign,
The
pledge
of
conquest
by
the
aid
divine.
Nor
long
his
falchion
in
the
scabbard
slept,
His
warlike
arm
increasing
laurels
reap'd:
From
Leyra's
walls
the
baffled
Ismar
flies,
And
strong
Arroncha
falls
his
conquer'd
prize;
That
hononr'd
town,
through
whose
Elysian
groves
Thy
smooth
and
limpid
wave,
O
Tagus,
roves.
Th'
illustrious
Santarene
confess'd
his
power,
And
vanquish'd
Mafra
yields
her
proudest
tower.
The
Lunar
mountains
saw
his
troops
display
Their
marching
banners
and
their
brave
array:
To
him
submits
fair
Cintra's
cold
domain,
The
soothing
refuge
of
the
Naiad
train.
When
Love's
sweet
snares
the
pining
nymphs
would
shun:
Alas,
in
vain,
from
warmer
climes
they
run:
The
cooling
shades
awake
the
young
desires,
And
the
cold
fountains
cherish
love's
soft
fires.
And
thou,
famed
Lisbon,
whose
embattled
wall
Rose
by
the
hand
that
wrought
proud
Ilion's[217]
fall;[218]
Thou
queen
of
cities,
whom
the
seas
obey,
Thy
dreaded
ramparts
own'd
the
hero's
sway.
Far
from
the
north
a
warlike
navy
bore
From
Elbe,
from
Rhine,
and
Albion's
misty[219]
shore;
To
rescue
Salem's[220]
long-polluted
shrine
Their
force
to
great
Alonzo's
force
they
join:
Before
Ulysses'
walls
the
navy
rides,
The
joyful
Tagus
laves
their
pitchy
sides.
Five
times
the
moon
her
empty
horns
conceal'd,
Five
times
her
broad
effulgence
shone
reveal'd,
When,
wrapt
in
clouds
of
dust,
her
mural
pride
Falls
thund'ring,--black
the
smoking
breach
yawns
wide.
As,
when
th'
imprison'd
waters
burst
the
mounds,
And
roar,
wide
sweeping,
o'er
the
cultur'd
grounds;
Nor
cot
nor
fold
withstand
their
furious
course;
So,
headlong
rush'd
along
the
hero's
force.
The
thirst
of
vengeance
the
assailants
fires,
The
madness
of
despair
the
Moors
inspires;
Each
lane,
each
street
resounds
the
conflict's
roar,
And
every
threshold
reeks
with
tepid
gore.
Thus
fell
the
city,
whose
unconquer'd[221]
towers
Defied
of
old
the
banded
Gothic
powers,
Whose
harden'd
nerves
in
rig'rous
climates
train'd
The
savage
courage
of
their
souls
sustain'd:
Before
whose
sword
the
sons
of
Ebro
fled,
And
Tagus
trembled
in
his
oozy
bed;
Aw'd
by
whose
arms
the
lawns
of
Betis'
shore
The
name
Vandalia
from
the
Vandals
bore.
When
Lisbon's
towers
before
the
Lusian
fell,
What
fort,
what
rampart
might
his
arms
repel!
Estremadura's
region
owns
him
lord,
And
Torres-vedras
bends
beneath
his
sword;
Obidos
humbles,
and
Alamquer
yields,
Alamquer
famous
for
her
verdant
fields,
Whose
murm'ring
riv'lets
cheer
the
traveller's
way,
As
the
chill
waters
o'er
the
pebbles
stray.
Elva
the
green,
and
Moura's
fertile
dales,
Fair
Serpa's
tillage,
and
Alcazar's
vales
Not
for
himself
the
Moorish
peasant
sows;
For
Lusian
hands
the
yellow
harvest
glows:
And
you,
fair
lawns,
beyond
the
Tagus'
wave,
Your
golden
burdens
for
Alonzo
save;
Soon
shall
his
thund'ring
might
your
wealth
reclaim,
And
your
glad
valleys
hail
their
monarch's
name.
Nor
sleep
his
captains
while
the
sov'reign
wars;
The
brave
Giraldo's
sword
in
conquest
shares,
Evora's
frowning
walls,
the
castled
hold
Of
that
proud
Roman
chief,
and
rebel
bold,
Sertorious
dread,
whose
labours
still
remain;[222]
Two
hundred
arches,
stretch'd
in
length,
sustain
The
marble
duct,
where,
glist'ning
to
the
sun,
Of
silver
hue
the
shining
waters
run.
Evora's
frowning
walls
now
shake
with
fear,
And
yield,
obedient
to
Giraldo's
spear.
Nor
rests
the
monarch
while
his
servants
toil,
Around
him
still
increasing
trophies
smile,
And
deathless
fame
repays
the
hapless
fate
That
gives
to
human
life
so
short
a
date.
Proud
Beja's
castled
walls
his
fury
storms,
And
one
red
slaughter
every
lane
deforms.
The
ghosts,
whose
mangled
limbs,
yet
scarcely
cold,
Heap'd,
sad
Trancoso's
streets
in
carnage
roll'd,
Appeas'd,
the
vengeance
of
their
slaughter
see,
And
hail
th'
indignant
king's
severe
decree.
Palmela
trembles
on
her
mountain's
height,
And
sea-laved
Zambra
owns
the
hero's
might.
Nor
these
alone
confess'd
his
happy
star,
Their
fated
doom
produc'd
a
nobler
war.
Badaja's[223]
king,
a
haughty
Moor,
beheld
His
towns
besieg'd,
and
hasted
to
the
field.
Four
thousand
coursers
in
his
army
neigh'd,
Unnumber'd
spears
his
infantry
display'd;
Proudly
they
march'd,
and
glorious
to
behold,
In
silver
belts
they
shone,
and
plates
of
gold.
Along
a
mountain's
side
secure
they
trod,
Steep
on
each
hand,
and
rugged
was
the
road;
When,
as
a
bull,
whose
lustful
veins
betray
The
madd'ning
tumult
of
inspiring
May;
If,
when
his
rage
with
fiercest
ardour
glows,
When
in
the
shade
the
fragrant
heifer
lows,
If
then,
perchance,
his
jealous
burning
eye
Behold
a
careless
traveller
wander
by,
With
dreadful
bellowing
on
the
wretch
he
flies,
The
wretch
defenceless,
torn
and
trampled
dies.
So
rush'd
Alonzo
on
the
gaudy
train,
And
pour'd
victorious
o'er
the
mangled
slain;
The
royal
Moor
precipitates
in
flight,
The
mountain
echoes
with
the
wild
affright
Of
flying
squadrons;
down
their
arms
they
throw,
And
dash
from
rock
to
rock
to
shun
the
foe.
The
foe!
what
wonders
may
not
virtue
dare!
But
sixty
horsemen
wag'd
the
conqu'ring
war.[224]
The
warlike
monarch
still
his
toil
renews,
New
conquest
still
each
victory
pursues.
To
him
Badaja's
lofty
gates
expand,
And
the
wide
region
owns
his
dread
command.
When,
now
enraged,
proud
Leon's
king
beheld
Those
walls
subdued,
which
saw
his
troops
expell'd;
Enrag'd
he
saw
them
own
the
victor's
sway,
And
hems
them
round
with
battailous
array.
With
gen'rous
ire
the
brave
Alonzo
glows;
By
Heaven
unguarded,
on
the
num'rous
foes
He
rushes,
glorying
in
his
wonted
force,
And
spurs,
with
headlong
rage,
his
furious
horse;
The
combat
burns,
the
snorting
courser
bounds,
And
paws
impetuous
by
the
iron
mounds:
O'er
gasping
foes
and
sounding
bucklers
trod
The
raging
steed,
and
headlong
as
he
rode
Dash'd
the
fierce
monarch
on
a
rampire
bar--
Low
grovelling
in
the
dust,
the
pride
of
war,
The
great
Alonzo
lies.
The
captive's
fate
Succeeds,
alas,
the
pomp
of
regal
state.
"Let
iron
dash
his
limbs,"
his
mother
cried,
"And
steel
revenge
my
chains:"
she
spoke,
and
died;
And
Heaven
assented--Now
the
hour
was
come,
And
the
dire
curse
was
fallen
Alonzo's
doom.[225]
No
more,
O
Pompey,
of
thy
fate
complain,
No
more
with
sorrow
view
thy
glory's
stain;
Though
thy
tall
standards
tower'd
with
lordly
pride
Where
northern
Phasis[226]
rolls
his
icy
tide;
Though
hot
Syene,[227]
where
the
sun's
fierce
ray
Begets
no
shadow,
own'd
thy
conqu'ring
sway;
Though
from
the
tribes
that
shiver
in
the
gleam
Of
cold
Boötes'
wat'ry
glist'ning
team;
To
those
who
parch'd
beneath
the
burning
line,
In
fragrant
shades
their
feeble
limbs
recline,
The
various
languages
proclaim'd
thy
fame,
And
trembling,
own'd
the
terrors
of
thy
name;
Though
rich
Arabia,
and
Sarmatia
bold,
And
Colchis,[228]
famous
for
the
fleece
of
gold;
Though
Judah's
land,
whose
sacred
rites
implor'd
The
One
true
God,
and,
as
he
taught,
ador'd;
Though
Cappadocia's
realm
thy
mandate
sway'd,
And
base
Sophenia's
sons
thy
nod
obey'd;
Though
vex'd
Cilicia's
pirates
wore
thy
bands,
And
those
who
cultur'd
fair
Armenia's
lands,
Where
from
the
sacred
mount
two
rivers
flow,
And
what
was
Eden
to
the
pilgrim
show;
Though
from
the
vast
Atlantic's
bounding
wave
To
where
the
northern
tempests
howl
and
rave
Round
Taurus'
lofty
brows:
though
vast
and
wide
The
various
climes
that
bended
to
thy
pride;
No
more
with
pining
anguish
of
regret
Bewail
the
horrors
of
Pharsalia's
fate:
For
great
Alonzo,
whose
superior
name
Unequall'd
victories
consign
to
fame,
The
great
Alonzo
fell--like
thine
his
woe;
From
nuptial
kindred
came
the
fatal
blow.
When
now
the
hero,
humbled
in
the
dust,
His
crime
aton'd,
confess'd
that
Heaven
was
just,
Again
in
splendour
he
the
throne
ascends:
Again
his
bow
the
Moorish
chieftain
bends.
Wide
round
th'
embattl'd
gates
of
Santareen
Their
shining
spears
and
banner'd
moons
are
seen.
But
holy
rites
the
pious
king
preferr'd;
The
martyr's
bones
on
Vincent's
Cape
interr'd
(His
sainted
name
the
Cape
shall
ever
bear),[229]
To
Lisbon's
walls
he
brought
with
votive
care.
And
now
the
monarch,
old
and
feeble
grown,
Resigns
the
falchion
to
his
valiant
son.
O'er
Tagus'
waves
the
youthful
hero
pass'd,
And
bleeding
hosts
before
him
shrunk
aghast.
Chok'd
with
the
slain,
with
Moorish
carnage
dy'd,
Sevilia's
river
roll'd
the
purple
tide.
Burning
for
victory,
the
warlike
boy
Spares
not
a
day
to
thoughtless
rest
or
joy.
Nor
long
his
wish
unsatisfied
remains:
With
the
besiegers'
gore
he
dyes
the
plains
That
circle
Beja's
wall:
yet
still
untam'd,
With
all
the
fierceness
of
despair
inflam'd,
The
raging
Moor
collects
his
distant
might;
Wide
from
the
shores
of
Atlas'
starry
height,
From
Amphelusia's
cape,
and
Tingia's[230]
bay,
Where
stern
Antæus
held
his
brutal
sway,
The
Mauritanian
trumpet
sounds
to
arms;
And
Juba's
realm
returns
the
hoarse
alarms;
The
swarthy
tribes
in
burnish'd
armour
shine,
Their
warlike
march
Abyla's
shepherds
join.
The
great
Miramolin[231]
on
Tagus'
shores
Far
o'er
the
coast
his
banner'd
thousands
pours;
Twelve
kings
and
one
beneath
his
ensigns
stand,
And
wield
their
sabres
at
his
dread
command.
The
plund'ring
bands
far
round
the
region
haste,
The
mournful
region
lies
a
naked
waste.
And
now,
enclos'd
in
Santareen's
high
towers,
The
brave
Don
Sancho
shuns
th'
unequal
powers;
A
thousand
arts
the
furious
Moor
pursues,
And
ceaseless,
still
the
fierce
assault
renews.
Huge
clefts
of
rock,
from
horrid
engines
whirl'd,
In
smould'ring
volleys
on
the
town
are
hurl'd;
The
brazen
rams
the
lofty
turrets
shake,
And,
mined
beneath,
the
deep
foundations
quake;
But
brave
Alonzo's
son,
as
danger
grows,
His
pride
inflam'd,
with
rising
courage
glows;
Each
coming
storm
of
missile
darts
he
wards,
Each
nodding
turret,
and
each
port
he
guards.
In
that
fair
city,
round
whose
verdant
meads
The
branching
river
of
Mondego[232]
spreads,
Long
worn
with
warlike
toils,
and
bent
with
years,
The
king
reposed,
when
Sancho's
fate
he
hears.
His
limbs
forget
the
feeble
steps
of
age,
And
the
hoar
warrior
burns
with
youthful
rage.
His
daring
vet'rans,
long
to
conquest
train'd,
He
leads--the
ground
with
Moorish
blood
is
stain'd;
Turbans,
and
robes
of
various
colours
wrought,
And
shiver'd
spears
in
streaming
carnage
float.
In
harness
gay
lies
many
a
welt'ring
steed,
And,
low
in
dust,
the
groaning
masters
bleed.
As
proud
Miramolin[233]
in
horror
fled,
Don
Sancho's
javelin
stretch'd
him
with
the
dead.
In
wild
dismay,
and
torn
with
gushing
wounds,
The
rout,
wide
scatter'd,
fly
the
Lusian
bounds.
Their
hands
to
heaven
the
joyful
victors
raise,
And
every
voice
resounds
the
song
of
praise;
"Nor
was
it
stumbling
chance,
nor
human
might;
"'Twas
guardian
Heaven,"
they
sung,
"that
ruled
the
fight."
This
blissful
day
Alonzo's
glories
crown'd;
But
pale
disease
now
gave
the
secret
wound;
Her
icy
hand
his
feeble
limbs
invades,
And
pining
languor
through
his
vitals
spreads.
The
glorious
monarch
to
the
tomb
descends,
A
nation's
grief
the
funeral
torch
attends.
Each
winding
shore
for
thee,
Alonzo,[234]
mourns,
Alonzo's
name
each
woeful
bay
returns;
For
thee
the
rivers
sigh
their
groves
among,
And
funeral
murmurs
wailing,
roll
along;
Their
swelling
tears
o'erflow
the
wide
campaign;
With
floating
heads,
for
thee,
the
yellow
grain,
For
thee
the
willow-bowers
and
copses
weep,
As
their
tall
boughs
lie
trembling
on
the
deep;
Adown
the
streams
the
tangled
vine-leaves
flow,
And
all
the
landscape
wears
the
look
of
woe.
Thus,
o'er
the
wond'ring
world
thy
glories
spread,
And
thus
thy
mournful
people
bow
the
head;
While
still,
at
eve,
each
dale
Alonzo
sighs,
And,
oh,
Alonzo!
every
hill
replies;
And
still
the
mountain-echoes
trill
the
lay,
Till
blushing
morn
brings
on
the
noiseful
day.
The
youthful
Sancho
to
the
throne
succeeds,
Already
far
renown'd
for
val'rous
deeds;
Let
Betis',[235]
ting'd
with
blood,
his
prowess
tell,
And
Beja's
lawns,
where
boastful
Afric
fell.
Nor
less
when
king
his
martial
ardour
glows,
Proud
Sylves'
royal
walls
his
troops
enclose!
Fair
Sylves'
lawns
the
Moorish
peasant
plough'd,
Her
vineyards
cultur'd,
and
her
valleys
sow'd;
But
Lisbon's
monarch
reap'd.
The
winds
of
heaven[236]
Roar'd
high--and
headlong
by
the
tempest
driven,
In
Tagus'
breast
a
gallant
navy
sought
The
shelt'ring
port,
and
glad
assistance
brought.
The
warlike
crew,
by
Frederic
the
Red,[237]
To
rescue
Judah's
prostrate
land
were
led;
When
Guido's
troops,
by
burning
thirst
subdu'd,
To
Saladin,
the
foe,
for
mercy
su'd.
Their
vows
were
holy,
and
the
cause
the
same,
To
blot
from
Europe's
shores
the
Moorish
name.
In
Sancho's
cause
the
gallant
navy
joins,
And
royal
Sylves
to
their
force
resigns.
Thus,
sent
by
Heaven,
a
foreign
naval
band
Gave
Lisbon's
ramparts
to
the
sire's
command.
Nor
Moorish
trophies
did
alone
adorn
The
hero's
name;
in
warlike
camps
though
born,
Though
fenc'd
with
mountains,
Leon's
martial
race.
Smile
at
the
battle-sign,
yet
foul
disgrace
To
Leon's
haughty
sons
his
sword
achiev'd:
Proud
Tui's
neck
his
servile
yoke
receiv'd;
And,
far
around,
falls
many
a
wealthy
town,
O
valiant
Sancho,
humbled
to
thy
frown.
While
thus
his
laurels
flourish'd
wide
and
fair
He
dies:
Alonzo
reigns,
his
much-lov'd
heir.
Alcazar
lately
conquer'd
from
the
Moor,
Reconquer'd,
streams
with
the
defenders'
gore.
Alonzo
dead,
another
Sancho
reigns:
Alas,
with
many
a
sigh
the
land
complains!
Unlike
his
sire,
a
vain
unthinking
boy,
His
servants
now
a
jarring
sway
enjoy.
As
his
the
power,
his
were
the
crimes
of
those
Whom
to
dispense
that
sacred
power
he
chose.
By
various
counsels
waver'd,
and
confus'd
By
seeming
friends,
by
various
arts,
abus'd;
Long
undetermin'd,
blindly
rash
at
last,
Enrag'd,
unmann'd,
untutor'd
by
the
past.
Yet,
not
like
Nero,
cruel
and
unjust,
The
slave
capricious
of
unnatural
lust.
Nor
had
he
smil'd
had
flames
consum'd
his
Troy;
Nor
could
his
people's
groans
afford
him
joy;
Nor
did
his
woes
from
female
manners
spring,
Unlike
the
Syrian,[238]
or
Sicilia's
king.
No
hundred
cooks
his
costly
meal
prepar'd,
As
heap'd
the
board
when
Rome's
proud
tyrant
far'd.[239]
Nor
dar'd
the
artist
hope
his
ear
to[240]
gain,
By
new-form'd
arts
to
point
the
stings
of
pain.
But,
proud
and
high
the
Lusian
spirit
soar'd,
And
ask'd
a
godlike
hero
for
their
lord.
To
none
accustom'd
but
a
hero's
sway,
Great
must
he
be
whom
that
bold
race
obey.
Complaint,
loud
murmur'd,
every
city
fills,
Complaint,
loud
echo'd,
murmurs
through
the
hills.
Alarm'd,
Bolonia's
warlike
Earl[241]
awakes,
And
from
his
listless
brother's
minions
takes
The
awful
sceptre.--Soon
was
joy
restor'd,
And
soon,
by
just
succession,
Lisbon's
lord
Beloved,
Alonzo,
nam'd
the
Bold,
he
reigns;
Nor
may
the
limits
of
his
sire's
domains
Confine
his
mounting
spirit.
When
he
led
His
smiling
consort
to
the
bridal
bed,
"Algarbia's
realm,"
he
said,
"shall
prove
thy
dower,"
And,
soon
Algarbia,
conquer'd,
own'd
his
power.
The
vanquish'd
Moor
with
total
rout
expell'd,
All
Lusus'
shores
his
might
unrivall'd
held.
And
now
brave
Diniz
reigns,
whose
noble
fire
Bespoke
the
genuine
lineage
of
his
sire.
Now,
heavenly
peace
wide
wav'd
her
olive
bough,
Each
vale
display'd
the
labours
of
the
plough,
And
smil'd
with
joy:
the
rocks
on
every
shore
Resound
the
dashing
of
the
merchant-oar.
Wise
laws
are
form'd,
and
constitutions
weigh'd,
And
the
deep-rooted
base
of
Empire
laid.
Not
Ammon's
son[242]
with
larger
heart
bestow'd,
Nor
such
the
grace
to
him
the
Muses
owed.
From
Helicon
the
Muses
wing
their
way,
Mondego's[243]
flow'ry
banks
invite
their
stay.
Now
Coimbra
shines
Minerva's
proud
abode;
And
fir'd
with
joy,
Parnassus'
bloomy
god
Beholds
another
dear-lov'd
Athens
rise,
And
spread
her
laurels
in
indulgent
skies;
Her
wreath
of
laurels,
ever
green,
he
twines
With
threads
of
gold,
and
baccaris[244]
adjoins.
Here
castle
walls
in
warlike
grandeur
lower,
Here
cities
swell,
and
lofty
temples
tower:
In
wealth
and
grandeur
each
with
other
vies:
When
old
and
lov'd
the
parent-monarch
dies.
His
son,
alas,
remiss
in
filial
deeds,
But
wise
in
peace,
and
bold
in
fight,
succeeds,
The
fourth
Alonzo:
Ever
arm'd
for
war
He
views
the
stern
Castile
with
watchful
care.
Yet,
when
the
Libyan
nations
cross'd
the
main,
And
spread
their
thousands
o'er
the
fields
of
Spain,
The
brave
Alonzo
drew
his
awful
steel,
And
sprung
to
battle
for
the
proud
Castile.
When
Babel's
haughty
queen[245]
unsheath'd
the
sword,
And
o'er
Hydaspes'
lawns
her
legions
pour'd;
When
dreadful
Attila,[246]
to
whom
was
given
That
fearful
name,
"the
Scourge
of
angry
Heaven,"
The
fields
of
trembling
Italy
o'erran
With
many
a
Gothic
tribe,
and
northern
clan;
Not
such
unnumber'd
banners
then
were
seen,
As
now
in
fair
Tartesia's
dales
convene;
Numidia's
bow,
and
Mauritania's
spear,
And
all
the
might
of
Hagar's
race
was
here;
Granada's
mongrels
join
their
num'rous
host,
To
those
who
dar'd
the
seas
from
Libya's
coast.
Aw'd
by
the
fury
of
such
pond'rous
force
The
proud
Castilian
tries
each
hop'd
resource;
Yet,
not
by
terror
for
himself
inspir'd,
For
Spain
he
trembl'd,
and
for
Spain
was
fir'd.
His
much-lov'd
bride,[247]
his
messenger,
he
sends,
And,
to
the
hostile
Lusian
lowly
bends.
The
much-lov'd
daughter
of
the
king
implor'd,
Now
sues
her
father
for
her
wedded
lord.
The
beauteous
dame
approach'd
the
palace
gate,
Where
her
great
sire
was
thron'd
in
regal
state:
On
her
fair
face
deep-settled
grief
appears,
And
her
mild
eyes
are
bath'd
in
glist'ning
tears;
Her
careless
ringlets,
as
a
mourner's,
flow
Adown
her
shoulders,
and
her
breasts
of
snow:
A
secret
transport
through
the
father
ran,
While
thus,
in
sighs,
the
royal
bride
began:--
"And
know'st
thou
not,
O
warlike
king,"
she
cried,
"That
furious
Afric
pours
her
peopled
tide--
Her
barb'rous
nations,
o'er
the
fields
of
Spain?
Morocco's
lord
commands
the
dreadful
train.
Ne'er
since
the
surges
bath'd
the
circling
coast,
Beneath
one
standard
march'd
so
dread
a
host:
Such
the
dire
fierceness
of
their
brutal
rage,
Pale
are
our
bravest
youth
as
palsied
age.
By
night
our
fathers'
shades
confess
their
fear,[248]
Their
shrieks
of
terror
from
the
tombs
we
hear:
To
stem
the
rage
of
these
unnumber'd
bands,
Alone,
O
sire,
my
gallant
husband
stands;
His
little
host
alone
their
breasts
oppose
To
the
barb'd
darts
of
Spain's
innum'rous
foes:
Then
haste,
O
monarch,
thou
whose
conqu'ring
spear
Has
chill'd
Malucca's[249]
sultry
waves
with
fear:
Haste
to
the
rescue
of
distress'd
Castile,
(Oh!
be
that
smile
thy
dear
affection's
seal!)
And
speed,
my
father,
ere
my
husband's
fate
Be
fix'd,
and
I,
deprived
of
regal
state,
Be
left
in
captive
solitude
forlorn,
My
spouse,
my
kingdom,
and
my
birth
to
mourn."
In
tears,
and
trembling,
spoke
the
filial
queen.
So,
lost
in
grief,
was
lovely
Venus[250]
seen,
When
Jove,
her
sire,
the
beauteous
mourner
pray'd
To
grant
her
wand'ring
son
the
promis'd
aid.
Great
Jove
was
mov'd
to
hear
the
fair
deplore,
Gave
all
she
ask'd,
and
griev'd
she
ask'd
no
more.
So
griev'd
Alonzo's
noble
heart.
And
now
The
warrior
binds
in
steel
his
awful
brow;
The
glitt'ring
squadrons
march
in
proud
array,
On
burnish'd
shields
the
trembling
sunbeams
play:
The
blaze
of
arms
the
warlike
rage
inspires,
And
wakes
from
slothful
peace
the
hero's
fires.
With
trampling
hoofs
Evora's
plains
rebound,
And
sprightly
neighings
echo
far
around;
Far
on
each
side
the
clouds
of
dust
arise,
The
drum's
rough
rattling
rolls
along
the
skies;
The
trumpet's
shrilly
clangor
sounds
alarms,
And
each
heart
burns,
and
ardent,
pants
for
arms.
Where
their
bright
blaze
the
royal
ensigns
pour'd,
High
o'er
the
rest
the
great
Alonzo
tower'd;
High
o'er
the
rest
was
his
bold
front
admir'd,
And
his
keen
eyes
new
warmth,
new
force
inspir'd.
Proudly
he
march'd,
and
now,
in
Tarif's
plain
The
two
Alonzos
join
their
martial
train:
Right
to
the
foe,
in
battle-rank
updrawn,
They
pause--the
mountain
and
the
wide-spread
lawn
Afford
not
foot-room
for
the
crowded
foe:
Aw'd
with
the
horrors
of
the
lifted
blow
Pale
look'd
our
bravest
heroes.
Swell'd
with
pride,
}
The
foes
already
conquer'd
Spain
divide,
}
And,
lordly
o'er
the
field
the
promis'd
victors
stride.
}
So,
strode
in
Elah's
vale
the
tow'ring
height
Of
Gath's
proud
champion;[251]
so,
with
pale
affright,
The
Hebrews
trembled,
while
with
impious
pride
The
huge-limb'd
foe
the
shepherd
boy[252]
defied:
The
valiant
boy
advancing,
fits
the
string,
And
round
his
head
he
whirls
the
sounding
sling;
The
monster
staggers
with
the
forceful
wound,
And
his
huge
bulk
lies
groaning
on
the
ground.
Such
impious
scorn
the
Moor's
proud
bosom
swell'd,
When
our
thin
squadrons
took
the
battle-field;
Unconscious
of
the
Power
who
led
us
on,
That
Power
whose
nod
confounds
th'
eternal
throne;
Led
by
that
Power,
the
brave
Castilian
bar'd
The
shining
blade,
and
proud
Morocco
dar'd
His
conqu'ring
brand
the
Lusian
hero
drew,
And
on
Granada's
sons
resistless
flew;
The
spear-staffs
crash,
the
splinters
hiss
around,
And
the
broad
bucklers
rattle
on
the
ground:
With
piercing
shrieks
the
Moors
their
prophet's
name,
And
ours,
their
guardian
saint,
aloud
acclaim.
Wounds
gush
on
wounds,
and
blows
resound
to
blows
A
lake
of
blood
the
level
plain
o'erflows;
The
wounded,
gasping
in
the
purple
tide,
Now
find
the
death
the
sword
but
half
supplied.
Though
wove[253]
and
quilted
by
their
ladies'
hands,
Vain
were
the
mail-plates
of
Granada's
bands.
With
such
dread
force
the
Lusian
rush'd
along,
Steep'd
in
red
carnage
lay
the
boastful
throng.
Yet
now,
disdainful
of
so
light
a
prize,
Fierce
o'er
the
field
the
thund'ring
hero
flies;
And
his
bold
arm
the
brave
Castilian
joins
In
dreadful
conflict
with
the
Moorish
lines.
The
parting
sun
now
pour'd
the
ruddy
blaze,
And
twinkling
Vesper
shot
his
silv'ry
rays
Athwart
the
gloom,
and
clos'd
the
glorious
day,
When,
low
in
dust,
the
strength
of
Afric
lay.
Such
dreadful
slaughter
of
the
boastful
Moor
Never
on
battle-field
was
heap'd
before;
Not
he
whose
childhood
vow'd[254]
eternal
hate
And
desp'rate
war
against
the
Roman
state:
Though
three
strong
coursers
bent
beneath
the
weight
Of
rings
of
gold
(by
many
a
Roman
knight,
Erewhile,
the
badge
of
rank
distinguish'd,
worn),
From
their
cold
hands
at
Cannæ's[255]
slaughter
torn;
Not
his
dread
sword
bespread
the
reeking
plain
With
such
wide
streams
of
gore,
and
hills
of
slain;
Nor
thine,
O
Titus,
swept
from
Salem's
land
Such
floods
of
ghosts,
rolled
down
to
death's
dark
strand;
Though,
ages
ere
she
fell,
the
prophets
old
The
dreadful
scene
of
Salem's
fall
foretold,
In
words
that
breathe
wild
horror:
nor
the
shore,
When
carnage
chok'd
the
stream,
so
smok'd
with
gore,
When
Marius'
fainting
legions
drank
the
flood,
Yet
warm,
and
purpled
with
Ambronian[256]
blood;
Not
such
the
heaps
as
now
the
plains
of
Tarif
strew'd.
While
glory,
thus,
Alonzo's
name
adorn'd,
To
Lisbon's
shores
the
happy
chief
return'd,
In
glorious
peace
and
well-deserv'd
repose,
His
course
of
fame,
and
honour'd
age
to
close.
When
now,
O
king,
a
damsel's
fate[257]
severe,
A
fate
which
ever
claims
the
woeful
tear,
Disgraced
his
honours----On
the
nymph's
'lorn
head
Relentless
rage
its
bitterest
rancour
shed:
Yet,
such
the
zeal
her
princely
lover
bore,
Her
breathless
corse
the
crown
of
Lisbon
wore.
'Twas
thou,
O
Love,
whose
dreaded
shafts
control
The
hind's
rude
heart,
and
tear
the
hero's
soul;
Thou,
ruthless
power,
with
bloodshed
never
cloy'd,
'Twas
thou
thy
lovely
votary
destroy'd.
Thy
thirst
still
burning
for
a
deeper
woe,
In
vain
to
thee
the
tears
of
beauty
flow;
The
breast
that
feels
thy
purest
flames
divine,
With
spouting
gore
must
bathe
thy
cruel
shrine.
Such
thy
dire
triumphs!--Thou,
O
nymph,
the
while,
Prophetic
of
the
god's
unpitying
guile,
In
tender
scenes
by
love-sick
fancy
wrought,
By
fear
oft
shifted,
as
by
fancy
brought,
In
sweet
Mondego's
ever-verdant
bowers,
Languish'd
away
the
slow
and
lonely
hours:
While
now,
as
terror
wak'd
thy
boding
fears,
The
conscious
stream
receiv'd
thy
pearly
tears;
And
now,
as
hope
reviv'd
the
brighter
flame,
Each
echo
sigh'd
thy
princely
lover's
name.
Nor
less
could
absence
from
thy
prince
remove
The
dear
remembrance
of
his
distant
love:
Thy
looks,
thy
smiles,
before
him
ever
glow,
And
o'er
his
melting
heart
endearing
flow:
By
night
his
slumbers
bring
thee
to
his
arms,
By
day
his
thoughts
still
wander
o'er
thy
charms:
By
night,
by
day,
each
thought
thy
loves
employ,
Each
thought
the
memory,
or
the
hope,
of
joy.
Though
fairest
princely
dames
invok'd
his
love,
No
princely
dame
his
constant
faith
could
move:
For
thee,
alone,
his
constant
passion
burn'd,
For
thee
the
proffer'd
royal
maids
he
scorn'd.
Ah,
hope
of
bliss
too
high--the
princely
dames
Refus'd,
dread
rage
the
father's
breast
inflames;
He,
with
an
old
man's
wintry
eye,
surveys
The
youth's
fond
love,
and
coldly
with
it
weighs
The
people's
murmurs
of
his
son's
delay
To
bless
the
nation
with
his
nuptial
day.
(Alas,
the
nuptial
day
was
past
unknown,
Which,
but
when
crown'd,
the
prince
could
dare
to
own.)
And,
with
the
fair
one's
blood,
the
vengeful
sire
Resolves
to
quench
his
Pedro's
faithful
fire.
Oh,
thou
dread
sword,
oft
stain'd
with
heroes'
gore,
Thou
awful
terror
of
the
prostrate
Moor,
What
rage
could
aim
thee
at
a
female
breast,
Unarm'd,
by
softness
and
by
love
possess'd!
Dragg'd
from
her
bower,
by
murd'rous
ruffian
hands,
Before
the
frowning
king
fair
Inez
stands;
Her
tears
of
artless
innocence,
her
air
So
mild,
so
lovely,
and
her
face
so
fair,
Mov'd
the
stern
monarch;
when,
with
eager
zeal,
Her
fierce
destroyers
urg'd
the
public
weal;
Dread
rage
again
the
tyrant's
soul
possess'd,
And
his
dark
brow
his
cruel
thoughts
confess'd;
O'er
her
fair
face
a
sudden
paleness
spread,
Her
throbbing
heart
with
gen'rous
anguish
bled,
Anguish
to
view
her
lover's
hopeless
woes,
And
all
the
mother
in
her
bosom
rose.
Her
beauteous
eyes,
in
trembling
tear-drops
drown'd,
To
heaven
she
lifted
(for
her
hands
were
bound);[258]
Then,
on
her
infants
turn'd
the
piteous
glance,
The
look
of
bleeding
woe;
the
babes
advance,
Smiling
in
innocence
of
infant
age,
Unaw'd,
unconscious
of
their
grandsire's
rage;
To
whom,
as
bursting
sorrow
gave
the
flow,
The
native
heart-sprung
eloquence
of
woe,
The
lovely
captive
thus:--"O
monarch,
hear,
If
e'er
to
thee
the
name
of
man
was
dear,
If
prowling
tigers,
or
the
wolf's
wild
brood
(Inspir'd
by
nature
with
the
lust
of
blood),
Have
yet
been
mov'd
the
weeping
babe
to
spare,
Nor
left,
but
tended
with
a
nurse's
care,
As
Rome's
great
founders[259]
to
the
world
were
given;
Shalt
thou,
who
wear'st
the
sacred
stamp
of
Heaven,
The
human
form
divine,
shalt
thou
deny
That
aid,
that
pity,
which
e'en
beasts
supply!
Oh,
that
thy
heart
were,
as
thy
looks
declare,
Of
human
mould,
superfluous
were
my
prayer;
Thou
couldst
not,
then,
a
helpless
damsel
slay,
Whose
sole
offence
in
fond
affection
lay,
In
faith
to
him
who
first
his
love
confess'd,
Who
first
to
love
allur'd
her
virgin
breast.
In
these
my
babes
shalt
thou
thine
image
see,
And,
still
tremendous,
hurl
thy
rage
on
me?
Me,
for
their
sakes,
if
yet
thou
wilt
not
spare,
Oh,
let
these
infants
prove
thy
pious
care![260]
Yet,
Pity's
lenient
current
ever
flows
From
that
brave
breast
where
genuine
valour
glows;
That
thou
art
brave,
let
vanquish'd
Afric
tell,
Then
let
thy
pity
o'er
mine
anguish
swell;
Ah,
let
my
woes,
unconscious
of
a
crime,
Procure
mine
exile
to
some
barb'rous
clime:
Give
me
to
wander
o'er
the
burning
plains
Of
Libya's
deserts,
or
the
wild
domains
Of
Scythia's
snow-clad
rocks,
and
frozen
shore;
There
let
me,
hopeless
of
return,
deplore:
Where
ghastly
horror
fills
the
dreary
vale,
Where
shrieks
and
howlings
die
on
every
gale,
The
lion's
roaring,
and
the
tiger's
yell,
There,
with
mine
infant
race,
consign'd
to
dwell,
There
let
me
try
that
piety
to
find,
In
vain
by
me
implor'd
from
human
kind:
There,
in
some
dreary
cavern's
rocky
womb,
Amid
the
horrors
of
sepulchral
gloom,
For
him
whose
love
I
mourn,
my
love
shall
glow,
The
sigh
shall
murmur,
and
the
tear
shall
flow:
All
my
fond
wish,
and
all
my
hope,
to
rear
These
infant
pledges
of
a
love
so
dear,
Amidst
my
griefs
a
soothing
glad
employ,
Amidst
my
fears
a
woeful,
hopeless
joy."
In
tears
she
utter'd--as
the
frozen
snow
Touch'd
by
the
spring's
mild
ray,
begins
to
flow,
So,
just
began
to
melt
his
stubborn
soul,
As
mild-ray'd
Pity
o'er
the
tyrant
stole;
But
destiny
forbade:
with
eager
zeal
(Again
pretended
for
the
public
weal),
Her
fierce
accusers
urg'd
her
speedy
doom;
Again,
dark
rage
diffus'd
its
horrid
gloom
O'er
stern
Alonzo's
brow:
swift
at
the
sign,
Their
swords,
unsheath'd,
around
her
brandish'd
shine.
O
foul
disgrace,
of
knighthood
lasting
stain,
By
men
of
arms
a
helpless
lady[261]
slain!
Thus
Pyrrhus,[262]
burning
with
unmanly
ire,
Fulfilled
the
mandate
of
his
furious
sire;
Disdainful
of
the
frantic
matron's[263]
prayer,
On
fair
Polyxena,
her
last
fond
care,
He
rush'd,
his
blade
yet
warm
with
Priam's
gore,
And
dash'd
the
daughter
on
the
sacred
floor;
While
mildly
she
her
raving
mother
eyed,
Resign'd
her
bosom
to
the
sword,
and
died.
Thus
Inez,
while
her
eyes
to
heaven
appeal,
Resigns
her
bosom
to
the
murd'ring
steel:
That
snowy
neck,
whose
matchless
form
sustain'd
The
loveliest
face
where
all
the
graces
reign'd,
Whose
charms
so
long
the
gallant
prince
enflam'd,
That
her
pale
corse
was
Lisbon's
queen[264]
proclaim'd,
That
snowy
neck
was
stain'd
with
spouting
gore,
Another
sword
her
lovely
bosom
tore.
The
flowers
that
glisten'd
with
her
tears
bedew'd,
Now
shrunk
and
languish'd
with
her
blood
embru'd.
As
when
a
rose,
ere-while
of
bloom
so
gay,
Thrown
from
the
careless
virgin's
breast
away,
Lies
faded
on
the
plain,
the
living
red,
The
snowy
white,
and
all
its
fragrance
fled;
So
from
her
cheeks
the
roses
died
away,
And
pale
in
death
the
beauteous
Inez
lay:
With
dreadful
smiles,
and
crimson'd
with
her
blood,
Round
the
wan
victim
the
stern
murd'rers
stood,
Unmindful
of
the
sure,
though
future
hour,
Sacred
to
vengeance
and
her
lover's
power.
O
Sun,
couldst
thou
so
foul
a
crime
behold,
Nor
veil
thine
head
in
darkness,
as
of
old[265]
A
sudden
night
unwonted
horror
cast
O'er
that
dire
banquet,
where
the
sire's
repast
The
son's
torn
limbs
supplied!--Yet
you,
ye
vales!
Ye
distant
forests,
and
ye
flow'ry
dales!
When
pale
and
sinking
to
the
dreadful
fall,
You
heard
her
quiv'ring
lips
on
Pedro
call;
Your
faithful
echoes
caught
the
parting
sound,
And
Pedro!
Pedro!
mournful,
sigh'd
around.
Nor
less
the
wood-nymphs
of
Mondego's
groves
Bewail'd
the
memory
of
her
hapless
loves:
Her
griefs
they
wept,
and,
to
a
plaintive
rill
Transform'd
their
tears,
which
weeps
and
murmurs
still.
To
give
immortal
pity
to
her
woe
They
taught
the
riv'let
through
her
bowers
to
flow,
And
still,
through
violet-beds,
the
fountain
pours
Its
plaintive
wailing,
and
is
named
Amours.[266]
Nor
long
her
blood
for
vengeance
cried
in
vain:
Her
gallant
lord
begins
his
awful
reign,
In
vain
her
murd'rers
for
refuge
fly,
Spain's
wildest
hills
no
place
of
rest
supply.
The
injur'd
lover's
and
the
monarch's
ire,
And
stern-brow'd
Justice
in
their
doom
conspire:
In
hissing
flames
they
die,
and
yield
their
souls
in
fire.[267]
Nor
this
alone
his
stedfast
soul
display'd:
Wide
o'er
the
land
he
wav'd
the
awful
blade
Of
red-arm'd
Justice.
From
the
shades
of
night
He
dragg'd
the
foul
adulterer
to
light:
The
robber
from
his
dark
retreat
was
led,
And
he
who
spilt
the
blood
of
murder,
bled.
Unmov'd
he
heard
the
proudest
noble
plead;
Where
Justice
aim'd
her
sword,
with
stubborn
speed
Fell
the
dire
stroke.
Nor
cruelty
inspir'd,
Noblest
humanity
his
bosom
fir'd.
The
caitiff,
starting
at
his
thoughts,
repress'd
The
seeds
of
murder
springing
in
his
breast.
His
outstretch'd
arm
the
lurking
thief
withheld,
For
fix'd
as
fate
he
knew
his
doom
was
seal'd.
Safe
in
his
monarch's
care
the
ploughman
reap'd,
And
proud
oppression
coward
distance
kept.
Pedro
the
Just[268]
the
peopled
towns
proclaim,
And
every
field
resounds
her
monarch's
name.
Of
this
brave
prince
the
soft
degen'rate
son,
Fernando
the
Remiss,
ascends
the
throne.
With
arm
unnerv'd
the
listless
soldier
lay
And
own'd
the
influence
of
a
nerveless
sway:
The
stern
Castilian
drew
the
vengeful
brand,
And
strode
proud
victor
o'er
the
trembling
land.
How
dread
the
hour,
when
injur'd
heaven,
in
rage,
Thunders
its
vengeance
on
a
guilty
age!
Unmanly
sloth
the
king,
the
nation
stain'd;
And
lewdness,
foster'd
by
the
monarch,
reign'd:
The
monarch
own'd
that
first
of
crimes
unjust,
The
wanton
revels
of
adult'rous
lust:
Such
was
his
rage
for
beauteous[269]
Leonore,
Her
from
her
husband's
widow'd
arms
he
tore:
Then
with
unbless'd,
unhallow'd
nuptials
stain'd
The
sacred
altar,
and
its
rites
profan'd.
Alas!
the
splendour
of
a
crown,
how
vain,
From
Heaven's
dread
eye
to
veil
the
dimmest
stain!
To
conqu'ring
Greece,
to
ruin'd
Troy,
what
woes,
What
ills
on
ills,
from
Helen's
rape
arose!
Let
Appius
own,
let
banish'd
Tarquin
tell
On
their
hot
rage
what
heavy
vengeance
fell.
One
female,
ravish'd,
Gibeah's
streets[270]
beheld,
O'er
Gibeah's
streets
the
blood
of
thousands
swell'd
In
vengeance
of
the
crime;
and
streams
of
blood
The
guilt
of
Zion's
sacred
bard[271]
pursued.
Yet
Love,
full
oft,
with
wild
delirium
blinds,
And
fans
his
basest
fires
in
noblest
minds;
The
female
garb
the
great
Alcides[272]
wore,
And
for
his
Omphăle
the
distaff[273]
bore.
For
Cleopatra's
frown
the
world
was
lost:
The
Roman
terror,
and
the
Punic
boast,
Cannæ's
great
victor,[274]
for
a
harlot's
smile,
Resign'd
the
harvest
of
his
glorious
toil.
And
who
can
boast
he
never
felt
the
fires,
The
trembling
throbbings
of
the
young
desires,
When
he
beheld
the
breathing
roses
glow,
And
the
soft
heavings
of
the
living
snow;
The
waving
ringlets
of
the
auburn
hair,
And
all
the
rapt'rous
graces
of
the
fair!
Oh!
what
defence,
if
fix'd
on
him,
he
spy
The
languid
sweetness
of
the
stedfast
eye!
Ye
who
have
felt
the
dear,
luxurious
smart,
When
angel-charms
oppress
the
powerless
heart,
In
pity
here
relent
the
brow
severe,
And
o'er
Fernando's
weakness
drop
the
tear.
To
conclude
the
notes
on
this
book,
it
may
not
be
unnecessary
to
observe
that
Camoëns,
in
this
episode,
has
happily
adhered
to
a
principal
rule
of
the
Epopea.
To
paint
the
manners
and
characters
of
the
age
in
which
the
action
is
placed,
is
as
requisite
in
the
epic
poem
as
it
is
to
preserve
the
unity
of
the
character
of
an
individual.
That
gallantry
of
bravery
and
romantic
cast
of
the
military
adventures,
which
characterised
the
Spaniards
and
Portuguese
during
the
Moorish
wars,
is
happily
supported
by
Camoëns
in
its
most
just
and
striking
colours.
In
storming
the
citadel
of
Arzila,
the
Count
de
Marialva,
a
brave
old
officer,
lost
his
life.
The
king,
leading
his
only
son,
the
Prince
Don
Juan,
to
the
body
of
the
count,
while
the
blood
yet
streamed
from
his
wounds:
"Behold,"
he
cried,
"that
great
man!
May
God
grant
you,
my
son,
to
imitate
his
virtues.
May
your
honour,
like
his,
be
complete!"
BOOK
IV.
THE
ARGUMENT.
STATE
OF
PORTUGAL
ON
THE
DEATH
OF
DOM
FERNANDO.
Beatrice,
daughter
of
Fernando,
not
acknowledged
by
the
Portuguese,
the
throne
is
occupied
by
Don
John,
a
natural
brother
of
Fernando.
A
Spanish
prince
having
married
Beatrice,
the
Spaniards
invade
Portugal,
which
they
claim
by
right
of
marriage.
The
Portuguese,
divided
in
council,
are
harangued
in
an
eloquent
speech
by
Don
Nuño
Alvarez
Pereyra;
he
rallies
the
nobility
around
the
king,
who
conquers
the
Castilians
on
the
gory
field
of
Aljubarota.
Nuño
Alvarez,
following
up
his
victory,
penetrates
as
far
as
Seville,
where
he
dictates
the
terms
of
peace
to
the
haughty
Spaniards.
Don
John
carries
war
against
the
Moors
into
Africa.
His
son,
Edward,
renews
hostilities
with
the
African
Moors:
his
brother,
Don
Fernando,
surnamed
the
Inflexible,
taken
prisoner,
prefers
death
in
captivity
to
the
surrender
of
Ceuta
to
the
Moors,
as
the
price
of
his
ransom.
Alfonso
V.
succeeds
to
the
throne
of
Portugal;
is
victorious
over
the
Moors,
but
conquered
by
the
Castilians.
John
II.,
the
thirteenth
king
of
Portugal,
sends
out
adventurers
to
find
a
way,
by
land,
to
India;
they
perish
at
the
mouth
of
the
Indus.
Emmanuel,
succeeding
to
the
throne,
resolves
on
continuing
the
discoveries
of
his
predecessors.
The
rivers
Indus
and
Ganges,
personified,
appear
in
a
vision
to
Emmanuel,
who,
in
consequence,
makes
choice
of
Vasco
de
Gama
to
command
an
expedition
to
the
East.
As
the
toss'd
vessel
on
the
ocean
rolls,
When
dark
the
night,
and
loud
the
tempest
howls,
When
the
'lorn
mariner
in
every
wave
That
breaks
and
gleams,
forebodes
his
wat'ry
grave;
But
when
the
dawn,
all
silent
and
serene,
With
soft-pac'd
ray
dispels
the
shades
obscene,
With
grateful
transport
sparkling
in
each
eye,
The
joyful
crew
the
port
of
safety
spy;
Such
darkling
tempests,
and
portended
fate,
While
weak
Fernando
liv'd,
appall'd
the
state;
Such
when
he
died,
the
peaceful
morning
rose,
The
dawn
of
joy,
and
sooth'd
the
public
woes.
As
blazing
glorious
o'er
the
shades
of
night,
Bright
in
his
east
breaks
forth
the
lord
of
light,
So,
valiant
John
with
dazzling
blaze
appears,
And,
from
the
dust
his
drooping
nation
rears.
Though
sprung
from
youthful
passion's
wanton
loves,[275]
Great
Pedro's
son
in
noble
soul
he
proves;
And
Heaven
announc'd
him
king
by
right
divine;--
A
cradled
infant
gave
the
wondrous
sign.[276]
Her
tongue
had
never
lisp'd
the
mother's
name,
No
word,
no
mimic
sound
her
lips
could
frame,
When
Heaven
the
miracle
of
speech
inspir'd:
She
raised
her
little
hands,
with
rapture
fir'd,
"Let
Portugal,"
she
cried,
"with
joy
proclaim
The
brave
Don
John,
and
own
her
monarch's
name."
The
burning
fever
of
domestic
rage
Now
wildly
rav'd,
and
mark'd
the
barb'rous
age;
Through
every
rank
the
headlong
fury
ran,
And
first,
red
slaughter
in
the
court
began.
Of
spousal
vows,
and
widow'd
bed
defil'd,
Loud
fame
the
beauteous
Leonore
revil'd.
The
adult'rous
noble
in
her
presence
bled,
And,
torn
with
wounds,
his
num'rous
friends
lay
dead.
No
more
those
ghastly,
deathful
nights
amaze,
When
Rome
wept
tears
of
blood
in
Scylla's
days:
More
horrid
deeds
Ulysses'
towers[277]
beheld:
Each
cruel
breast,
where
rankling
envy
swell'd,
Accus'd
his
foe
as
minion
of
the
queen;
Accus'd,
and
murder
closed
the
dreary
scene.
All
holy
ties
the
frantic
transport
brav'd,
Nor
sacred
priesthood,
nor
the
altar
sav'd.
Thrown
from
a
tower,
like
Hector's
son
of
yore,
The
mitred
head[278]
was
dash'd
with
brains
and
gore.
Ghastly
with
scenes
of
death,
and
mangled
limbs,
And,
black
with
clotted
blood,
each
pavement
swims.
With
all
the
fierceness
of
the
female
ire,
When
rage
and
grief
to
tear
the
breast
conspire,
The
queen
beheld
her
power,
her
honours
lost,[279]
And
ever,
when
she
slept,
th'
adult'rer's
ghost,
All
pale,
and
pointing
at
his
bloody
shroud,
Seem'd
ever
for
revenge
to
scream
aloud.
Castile's
proud
monarch
to
the
nuptial
bed,
In
happier
days,
her
royal
daughter[280]
led.
To
him
the
furious
queen
for
vengeance
cries,
Implores
to
vindicate
his
lawful
prize,
The
Lusian
sceptre,
his
by
spousal
right;
The
proud
Castilian
arms,
and
dares
the
fight.
To
join
his
standard
as
it
waves
along,
The
warlike
troops
from
various
regions
throng:
Those
who
possess
the
lands
by
Rodrick
given,[281]
What
time
the
Moor
from
Turia's
banks
was
driven;
That
race
who
joyful
smile
at
war's
alarms,
And
scorn
each
danger
that
attends
on
arms;
Whose
crooked
ploughshares
Leon's
uplands
tear,
Now,
cas'd
in
steel,
in
glitt'ring
arms
appear,
Those
arms
erewhile
so
dreadful
to
the
Moor:
The
Vandals
glorying
in
their
might
of
yore
March
on;
their
helms,
and
moving
lances
gleam
Along
the
flow'ry
vales
of
Betis'
stream:
Nor
stay'd
the
Tyrian
islanders[282]
behind,
On
whose
proud
ensigns,
floating
on
the
wind,
Alcides'
pillars[283]
tower'd:
Nor
wonted
fear
Withheld
the
base
Galician's
sordid
spear;
Though,
still,
his
crimson
seamy
scars
reveal
The
sure-aimed
vengeance
of
the
Lusian
steel.
Where,
tumbling
down
Cuenca's
mountain
side,
The
murm'ring
Tagus
rolls
his
foamy
tide,
Along
Toledo's
lawns,
the
pride
of
Spain,
Toledo's
warriors
join
the
martial
train:
Nor
less
the
furious
lust
of
war
inspires
The
Biscayneer,[284]
and
wakes
his
barb'rous
fires,
Which
ever
burn
for
vengeance,
if
the
tongue
Of
hapless
stranger
give
the
fancied
wrong.
Nor
bold
Asturia,
nor
Guipuscoa's
shore,
Famed
for
their
steely
wealth,
and
iron
ore,
Delay'd
their
vaunting
squadrons;
o'er
the
dales
Cas'd
in
their
native
steel,
and
belted
mails,
Blue
gleaming
from
afar,
they
march
along,
And
join,
with
many
a
spear,
the
warlike
throng.
As
thus,
wide
sweeping
o'er
the
trembling
coast,
The
proud
Castilian
leads
his
num'rous
host;
The
valiant
John
for
brave
defence
prepares,
And,
in
himself
collected,
greatly
dares:
For
such
high
valour
in
his
bosom
glow'd,
As
Samson's
locks[285]
by
miracle
bestow'd:
Safe,
in
himself
resolv'd,
the
hero
stands,
Yet,
calls
the
leaders
of
his
anxious
bands:
The
council
summon'd,
some
with
prudent
mien,
And
words
of
grave
advice
their
terrors
screen.
By
sloth
debas'd,
no
more
the
ancient
fire
Of
patriot
loyalty
can
now
inspire;
And
each
pale
lip
seem'd
opening
to
declare
For
tame
submission,
and
to
shun
the
war;
When
glorious
Nunio,
starting
from
his
seat,
Claim'd
every
eye,
and
clos'd
the
cold
debate:
Singling
his
brothers
from
the
dastard
train,
His
rolling
looks,
that
flash'd
with
stern
disdain,
On
them
he
fix'd,
then
snatch'd
his
hilt
in
ire,
While
his
bold
speech[286]
bewray'd
the
soldier's
fire,
Bold
and
unpolish'd;
while
his
burning
eyes
Seem'd
as
he
dar'd
the
ocean,
earth,
and
skies.
"Heavens!
shall
the
Lusian
nobles
tamely
yield!
Oh,
shame!
and
yield,
untried,
the
martial
field!
That
land
whose
genius,
as
the
god
of
war,
Was
own'd,
where'er
approach'd
her
thund'ring
car;
Shall
now
her
sons
their
faith,
their
love
deny,
And,
while
their
country
sinks,
ignobly
fly;
Ye
tim'rous
herd,
are
ye
the
genuine
line
Of
those
illustrious
shades,
whose
rage
divine,
Beneath
great
Henry's
standards
aw'd
the
foe,
For
whom
ye
tremble
and
would
stoop
so
low!
That
foe,
who,
boastful
now,
then
basely
fled,
When
your
undaunted
sires
the
hero
led,
When
seven
bold
earls,
in
chains,
the
spoil
adorn'd,
And
proud
Castile
through
all
her
kindreds
mourn'd,
Castile,
your
awful
dread--yet,
conscious,
say,
When
Diniz
reign'd,
when
his
bold
son
bore
sway,
By
whom
were
trodden
down
the
bravest
bands
That
ever
march'd
from
proud
Castilia's
lands?
'Twas
your
brave
sires--and
has
one
languid
reign
Fix'd
in
your
tainted
souls
so
deep
a
stain,
That
now,
degen'rate
from
your
noble
sires,
The
last
dim
spark
of
Lusian
flame
expires?
Though
weak
Fernando
reign'd,
in
war
unskill'd,
A
godlike
king
now
calls
you
to
the
field.
Oh!
could
like
his,
your
mounting
valour
glow,
Vain
were
the
threat'nings
of
the
vaunting
foe.
Not
proud
Castile,
oft
by
your
sires
o'erthrown,
But
ev'ry
land
your
dauntless
rage
should
own.
Still,
if
your
hands,
benumb'd
by
female
fear,
Shun
the
bold
war,
hark!
on
my
sword
I
swear,
Myself
alone
the
dreadful
war
shall
wage,
Mine
be
the
fight"--and,
trembling
with
the
rage
Of
val'rous
fire,
his
hand
half-drawn
display'd
The
awful
terror
of
his
shining
blade,--
"I
and
my
vassals
dare
the
dreadful
shock;
My
shoulders
never
to
a
foreign
yoke
Shall
bend;
and,
by
my
sov'reign's
wrath
I
vow,
And,
by
that
loyal
faith
renounc'd
by
you,
My
native
land
unconquer'd
shall
remain,
And
all
my
monarch's
foes
shall
heap
the
plain."
The
hero
paus'd--'Twas
thus
the
youth
of
Rome,
The
trembling
few
who
'scaped
the
bloody
doom
That
dy'd
with
slaughter
Cannæ's
purple
field,
Assembled
stood,
and
bow'd
their
necks
to
yield;
When
nobly
rising,
with
a
like
disdain,
The
young
Cornelius
rag'd,
nor
rag'd
in
vain:[287]
On
his
dread
sword
his
daunted
peers
he
swore,
(The
reeking
blade
yet
black
with
Punic
gore)
While
life
remain'd
their
arms
for
Rome
to
wield,
And,
but
with
life,
their
conquer'd
arms
to
yield.
Such
martial
rage
brave
Nunio's
mien
inspir'd;
Fear
was
no
more:
with
rapt'rous
ardour
fir'd,
"To
horse,
to
horse!"
the
gallant
Lusians
cried;
Rattled
the
belted
mails
on
every
side,
The
spear-staff
trembled;
round
their
necks
they
wav'd
Their
shining
falchions,
and
in
transport
rav'd,
"The
king
our
guardian!"--loud
their
shouts
rebound,
And
the
fierce
commons
echo
back
the
sound.
The
mails,
that
long
in
rusting
peace
had
hung,
Now
on
the
hammer'd
anvils
hoarsely
rung:
Some,
soft
with
wool,
the
plumy
helmets
line,
And
some
the
breast-plate's
scaly
belts
entwine:
The
gaudy
mantles
some,
and
scarfs
prepare,
Where
various
lightsome
colours
gaily
flare;
And
golden
tissue,
with
the
warp
enwove,
Displays
the
emblems
of
their
youthful
love.
The
valiant
John,
begirt
with
warlike
state,
Now
leads
his
bands
from
fair
Abrantes'
gate;
Whose
lawns
of
green
the
infant
Tagus
laves,
As
from
his
spring
he
rolls
his
cooly
waves.
The
daring
van,
in
Nunio's
care,
could
boast
A
general
worthy
of
th'
unnumber'd
host,
Whose
gaudy
banners
trembling
Greece
defied,
When
boastful
Xerxes
lash'd
the
Sestian[288]
tide:
Nunio,
to
proud
Castile
as
dread
a
name,
As
erst
to
Gaul
and
Italy
the
fame
Of
Attila's
impending
rage.
The
right
Brave
Roderic
led,
a
chieftain
train'd
in
fight;
Before
the
left
the
bold
Almada
rode;
And,
proudly
waving
o'er
the
centre,
nod
The
royal
ensigns,
glitt'ring
from
afar,
Where
godlike
John
inspires
and
leads
the
war.
'Twas
now
the
time,
when
from
the
stubbly
plain
The
lab'ring
hinds
had
borne
the
yellow
grain;
The
purple
vintage
heap'd
the
foamy
tun,
And
fierce,
and
red,
the
sun
of
August
shone;
When
from
the
gate
the
squadrons
march
along:
Crowds
press'd
on
crowds,
the
walls
and
ramparts
throng.
Here
the
sad
mother
rends
her
hoary
hair,
While
hope's
fond
whispers
struggle
with
despair:
The
weeping
spouse
to
Heaven
extends
her
hands:
And,
cold
with
dread,
the
modest
virgin
stands,
Her
earnest
eyes,
suffus'd
with
trembling
dew,
Far
o'er
the
plain
the
plighted
youth
pursue:
And
prayers,
and
tears,
and
all
the
female
wail,
And
holy
vows,
the
throne
of
Heaven
assail.
Now
each
stern
host
full
front
to
front
appears,
And
one
joint
shout
heaven's
airy
concave
tears:
A
dreadful
pause
ensues,
while
conscious
pride
Strives
on
each
face
the
heart-felt
doubt
to
hide.
Now
wild,
and
pale,
the
boldest
face
is
seen;
With
mouth
half
open,
and
disorder'd
mien,
Each
warrior
feels
his
creeping
blood
to
freeze,
And
languid
weakness
trembles
in
the
knees.
And
now,
the
clangor
of
the
trumpet
sounds,
And
the
rough
rattling
of
the
drum
rebounds:
The
fife's
shrill
whistling
cuts
the
gale,
on
high
The
flourish'd
ensigns
shine,
with
many
a
dye
Of
blazing
splendour:
o'er
the
ground
they
wheel
And
choose
their
footing,
when
the
proud
Castile
Bids
sound
the
horrid
charge;
loud
bursts
the
sound,
And
loud
Artabro's
rocky
cliffs
rebound:
The
thund'ring
roar
rolls
round
on
every
side,
And
trembling,
sinks
Guidana's[289]
rapid
tide;
The
slow-pac'd
Durius[290]
rushes
o'er
the
plain,
And
fearful
Tagus
hastens
to
the
main:
Such
was
the
tempest
of
the
dread
alarms,
The
babes
that
prattled
in
their
nurses'
arms
Shriek'd
at
the
sound:
with
sudden
cold
impress'd,
The
mothers
strain'd
their
infants
to
the
breast,
And
shook
with
horror.
Now,
far
round,
begin
The
bow-strings'
whizzing,
and
the
brazen[291]
din
Of
arms
on
armour
rattling;
either
van
Are
mingled
now,
and
man
oppos'd
to
man:
To
guard
his
native
fields
the
one
inspires,
And
one
the
raging
lust
of
conquest
fires:
Now
with
fix'd
teeth,
their
writhing
lips
of
blue,
Their
eye-balls
glaring
of
the
purple
hue,
Each
arm
strains
swiftest
to
impel
the
blow;
}
Nor
wounds
they
value
now,
nor
fear
they
know,
}
Their
only
passion
to
offend
the
foe.
}
In
might
and
fury,
like
the
warrior
god,
Before
his
troops
the
glorious
Nunio
rode:
That
land,
the
proud
invaders
claim'd,
he
sows
With
their
spilt
blood,
and
with
their
corpses
strews;
Their
forceful
volleys
now
the
cross-bows
pour,
The
clouds
are
darken'd
with
the
arrowy
shower;
The
white
foam
reeking
o'er
their
wavy
mane,
The
snorting
coursers
rage,
and
paw
the
plain;
Beat
by
their
iron
hoofs,
the
plain
rebounds,
As
distant
thunder
through
the
mountains
sounds:
The
pond'rous
spears
crash,
splint'ring
far
around;
The
horse
and
horsemen
flounder
on
the
ground;
The
ground
groans,
with
the
sudden
weight
oppress'd,
And
many
a
buckler
rings
on
many
a
crest.
Where,
wide
around,
the
raging
Nunio's
sword
With
furious
sway
the
bravest
squadrons
gor'd,
The
raging
foes
in
closer
ranks
advance,
And
his
own
brothers
shake
the
hostile
lance.[292]
Oh,
horrid
sight!
yet
not
the
ties
of
blood,
Nor
yearning
memory
his
rage
withstood;
With
proud
disdain
his
honest
eyes
behold
Whoe'er
the
traitor,
who
his
king
has
sold.
Nor
want
there
others
in
the
hostile
band
Who
draw
their
swords
against
their
native
land;
And,
headlong
driv'n,
by
impious
rage
accurs'd,
In
rank
were
foremost,
and
in
fight
the
first.
So,
sons
and
fathers,
by
each
other
slain,
With
horrid
slaughter
dyed
Pharsalia's[293]
plain.
Ye
dreary
ghosts,
who
now
for
treasons
foul,
Amidst
the
gloom
of
Stygian
darkness
howl;
Thou
Catiline,
and,
stern
Sertorius,
tell
Your
brother
shades,
and
soothe
the
pains
of
hell;
With
triumph
tell
them,
some
of
Lusian
race
Like
you
have
earn'd
the
traitor's
foul
disgrace.
As
waves
on
waves,
the
foes'
increasing
weight
Bears
down
our
foremost
ranks,
and
shakes
the
fight;
Yet,
firm
and
undismay'd
great
Nunio
stands,
And
braves
the
tumult
of
surrounding
bands.
So,
from
high
Ceuta's[294]
rocky
mountains
stray'd,
The
ranging
lion
braves
the
shepherd's
shade;
The
shepherds
hast'ning
o'er
the
Tetuan[295]
plain,
With
shouts
surround
him,
and
with
spears
restrain:
He
stops,
with
grinning
teeth
his
breath
he
draws,
Nor
is
it
fear,
but
rage,
that
makes
him
pause;
His
threat'ning
eyeballs
burn
with
sparkling
fire,
And,
his
stern
heart
forbids
him
to
retire:
Amidst
the
thickness
of
the
spears
he
flings,
So,
midst
his
foes,
the
furious
Nunio
springs:
The
Lusian
grass
with
foreign
gore
distain'd,
Displays
the
carnage
of
the
hero's
hand.
[An
ample
shield
the
brave
Giraldo
bore,
Which
from
the
vanquish'd
Perez'
arm
he
tore;
Pierc'd
through
that
shield,
cold
death
invades
his
eye,
And
dying
Perez
saw
his
victor
die.
Edward
and
Pedro,
emulous
of
fame,
The
same
their
friendship,
and
their
youth
the
same,
Through
the
fierce
Brigians[296]
hew'd
their
bloody
way,
Till,
in
a
cold
embrace,
the
striplings
lay.
Lopez
and
Vincent
rush'd
on
glorious
death,
And,
midst
their
slaughter'd
foes,
resign'd
their
breath.
Alonzo,
glorying
in
his
youthful
might,
Spurr'd
his
fierce
courser
through
the
stagg'ring
fight:
Shower'd
from
the
dashing
hoofs,
the
spatter'd
gore
Flies
round;
but,
soon
the
rider
vaunts
no
more:
Five
Spanish
swords
the
murm'ring
ghosts
atone,
Of
five
Castilians
by
his
arm
o'erthrown.
Transfix'd
with
three
Iberian
spears,
the
gay,
The
knightly
lover,
young
Hilario
lay:
Though,
like
a
rose,
cut
off
in
op'ning
bloom,
The
hero
weeps
not
for
his
early
doom;
Yet,
trembling
in
his
swimming
eye
appears
The
pearly
drop,
while
his
pale
cheek
he
rears;
To
call
his
lov'd
Antonia's
name
he
tries,
The
name
half
utter'd,
down
he
sinks,
and
dies.][297]
Now
through
his
shatter'd
ranks
the
monarch
strode,
And
now
before
his
rallied
squadrons
rode:
Brave
Nunio's
danger
from
afar
he
spies,
And
instant
to
his
aid
impetuous
flies.
So,
when
returning
from
the
plunder'd
folds,
The
lioness
her
empty
den
beholds,
Enrag'd
she
stands,
and
list'ning
to
the
gale,
She
hears
her
whelps
low
howling
in
the
vale;
The
living
sparkles
flashing
from
her
eyes,
To
the
Massylian[298]
shepherd-tents
she
flies;
She
groans,
she
roars,
and
echoing
far
around
The
seven
twin-mountains
tremble
at
the
sound:
So,
rag'd
the
king,
and,
with
a
chosen
train,
He
pours
resistless
o'er
the
heaps
of
slain.
"Oh,
bold
companions
of
my
toils,"
he
cries,
"Our
dear-lov'd
freedom
on
our
lances
lies;
Behold
your
friend,
your
monarch
leads
the
way,
And
dares
the
thickest
of
the
iron
fray.
Say,
shall
the
Lusian
race
forsake
their
king,
Where
spears
infuriate
on
the
bucklers
ring!"
He
spoke;
then
four
times
round
his
head
he
whirl'd
His
pond'rous
spear,
and
midst
the
foremost
hurl'd;
Deep
through
the
ranks
the
forceful
weapon
pass'd,
And
many
a
gasping
warrior
sigh'd
his
last.[299]
With
noble
shame
inspir'd,
and
mounting
rage,
His
bands
rush
on,
and
foot
to
foot
engage;
Thick
bursting
sparkles
from
the
blows
aspire;
Such
flashes
blaze,
their
swords
seem
dipp'd
in
fire;[300]
The
belts
of
steel
and
plates
of
brass
are
riv'n,
And
wound
for
wound,
and
death
for
death
is
giv'n.
The
first
in
honour
of
Saint
Jago's
band,[301]
A
naked
ghost
now
sought
the
gloomy
strand;
And
he
of
Calatrave,
the
sov'reign
knight,
}
Girt
with
whole
troops
his
arm
had
slain
in
fight,
}
Descended
murm'ring
to
the
shades
of
night.
}
Blaspheming
Heaven,
and
gash'd
with
many
a
wound,
Brave
Nunio's
rebel
kindred
gnaw'd
the
ground.
And
curs'd
their
fate,
and
died.
Ten
thousand
more
Who
held
no
title
and
no
office
bore,
And
nameless
nobles
who,
promiscuous
fell,
Appeas'd
that
day
the
foaming
dog
of
hell.[302]
Now,
low
the
proud
Castilian
standard
lies
Beneath
the
Lusian
flag;
a
vanquish'd
prize.
With
furious
madness
fired,
and
stern
disdain,
The
fierce
Iberians[303]
to
the
fight
again
Rush
headlong;
groans
and
yellings
of
despair
With
horrid
uproar
rend
the
trembling
air.
Hot
boils
the
blood,
thirst
burns,
and
every
breast
Pants,
every
limb,
with
fainty
weight
oppress'd,
Slow
now
obeys
the
will's
stern
ire,
and
slow
From
every
sword
descends
the
feeble
blow:
Till
rage
grew
languid,
and
tir'd
slaughter
found
No
arm
to
combat,
and
no
breast
to
wound.
Now
from
the
field
Castile's
proud
monarch
flies,[304]
In
wild
dismay
he
rolls
his
madd'ning
eyes,
And
leads
the
pale-lipp'd
flight,
swift
wing'd
with
fear,
}
As
drifted
smoke;
at
distance
disappear,
}
The
dusty
squadrons
of
the
scatter'd
rear;
}
Blaspheming
Heaven,
they
fly,
and
him
who
first
Forg'd
murd'ring
arms,
and
led
to
horrid
wars
accurs'd.
The
festive
days
by
heroes
old
ordain'd[305]
The
glorious
victor
on
the
field
remain'd.
The
funeral
rites,
and
holy
vows
he
paid:
Yet,
not
the
while
the
restless
Nunio
stay'd;
O'er
Tago's
waves
his
gallant
bands
he
led,
And
humbled
Spain
in
every
province
bled:
Sevilia's
standard
on
his
spear
he
bore,
And
Andalusia's
ensigns,
steep'd
in
gore.
Low
in
the
dust,
distress'd
Castilia
mourn'd,
And,
bath'd
in
tears,
each
eye
to
Heav'n
was
turn'd;
The
orphan's,
widow's,
and
the
hoary
sire's;
And
Heav'n
relenting,
quench'd
the
raging
fires
Of
mutual
hate:
from
England's
happy
shore
The
peaceful
seas
two
lovely
sisters
bore.[306]
The
rival
monarchs
to
the
nuptial
bed,
In
joyful
hour,
the
royal
virgins
led,
And
holy
peace
assum'd
her
blissful
reign,
Again
the
peasant
joy'd,
the
landscape
smiled
again.
But,
John's
brave
breast
to
warlike
cares
inur'd,
With
conscious
shame
the
sloth
of
ease
endu'rd,
When
not
a
foe
awak'd
his
a
rage
in
Spain,
The
valiant
hero
brav'd
the
foamy
main;
The
first,
nor
meanest,
of
our
kings
who
bore
The
Lusian
thunders
to
the
Afric
shore.
O'er
the
wild
waves
the
victor-banners
flow'd,
Their
silver
wings
a
thousand
eagles
show'd;
And,
proudly
swelling
to
the
whistling
gales,
The
seas
were
whiten'd
with
a
thousand
sails.
Beyond
the
columns
by
Alcides[307]
plac'd
To
bound
the
world,
the
zealous
warrior
pass'd.
The
shrines
of
Hagar's
race,
the
shrines
of
lust,
And
moon-crown'd
mosques
lay
smoking
in
the
dust.
O'er
Abyla's
high
steep
his
lance
he
rais'd,
On
Ceuta's
lofty
towers
his
standard
blaz'd:
Ceuta,
the
refuge
of
the
traitor
train,
His
vassal
now,
insures
the
peace
of
Spain.
But
ah,
how
soon
the
blaze
of
glory
dies![308]
Illustrious
John
ascends
his
native
skies.
His
gallant
offspring
prove
their
genuine
strain,
And
added
lands
increase
the
Lusian
reign.
Yet,
not
the
first
of
heroes
Edward
shone
His
happiest
days
long
hours
of
evil
own.
He
saw,
secluded
from
the
cheerful
day,
His
sainted
brother
pine
his
years
away.
O
glorious
youth,
in
captive
chains,
to
thee
What
suiting
honours
may
thy
land
decree![309]
Thy
nation
proffer'd,
and
the
foe
with
joy,
For
Ceuta's
towers,
prepar'd
to
yield
the
boy;
The
princely
hostage
nobly
spurns
the
thought
Of
freedom,
and
of
life
so
dearly
bought:
The
raging
vengeance
of
the
Moors
defies,
Gives
to
the
clanking
chains
his
limbs,
and
dies
A
dreary
prison-death.
Let
noisy
fame
No
more
unequall'd
hold
her
Codrus'
name;
Her
Regulus,
her
Curtius
boast
no
more,
Nor
those
the
honour'd
Decian
name
who
bore.
The
splendour
of
a
court,
to
them
unknown,
Exchang'd
for
deathful
Fate's
most
awful
frown,
To
distant
times,
through
every
land,
shall
blaze
The
self-devoted
Lusian's
nobler
praise.
Now,
to
the
tomb
the
hapless
king
descends,
His
son,
Alonzo,
brighter
fate
attends.
Alonzo!
dear
to
Lusus'
race
the
name;
Nor
his
the
meanest
in
the
rolls
of
fame.
His
might
resistless,
prostrate
Afric
own'd,
Beneath
his
yoke
the
Mauritanians[310]
groan'd,
And,
still
they
groan
beneath
the
Lusian
sway.
'Twas
his,
in
victor-pomp,
to
bear
away
The
golden
apples
from
Hesperia's
shore,
Which
but
the
son
of
Jove
had
snatch'd
before.
The
palm,
and
laurel,
round
his
temples
bound,
Display'd
his
triumphs
on
the
Moorish
ground.
When
proud
Arzilla's
strength,
Alcazer's
towers,
And
Tingia,
boastful
of
her
num'rous
powers,
Beheld
their
adamantine
walls
o'erturn'd,
Their
ramparts
levell'd,
and
their
temples
burn'd.
Great
was
the
day:
the
meanest
sword
that
fought
Beneath
the
Lusian
flag
such
wonders
wrought
As
from
the
muse
might
challenge
endless
fame,
Though
low
their
station,
and
untold
their
name.
Now,
stung
with
wild
ambition's
madd'ning
fires,
To
proud
Castilia's
throne
the
king[311]
aspires.
The
Lord
of
Arragon,
from
Cadiz'
walls,
And
hoar
Pyrene's[312]
sides
his
legions
calls;
The
num'rous
legions
to
his
standard
throng,
And
war,
with
horrid
strides,
now
stalks
along.
With
emulation
fir'd,
the
prince[313]
beheld
His
warlike
sire
ambitious
of
the
field;
Scornful
of
ease,
to
aid
his
arms
he
sped,
Nor
sped
in
vain:
The
raging
combat
bled:
Alonzo's
ranks
with
carnage
gor'd,
Dismay
Spread
her
cold
wings,
and
shook
his
firm
array;
To
flight
she
hurried;
while,
with
brow
serene,
The
martial
boy
beheld
the
deathful
scene.
With
curving
movement
o'er
the
field
he
rode,
Th'
opposing
troops
his
wheeling
squadrons
mow'd:
The
purple
dawn,
and
evening
sun
beheld
His
tents
encamp'd
assert
the
conquer'd
field.
Thus,
when
the
ghost
of
Julius[314]
hover'd
o'er
Philippi's
plain,
appeas'd
with
Roman
gore,
Octavius'
legions
left
the
field
in
flight,
While
happier
Marcus
triumph'd
in
the
fight.
When
endless
night
had
seal'd
his
mortal
eyes,
And
brave
Alonzo's
spirit
sought
the
skies,
The
second
of
the
name,
the
valiant
John,
Our
thirteenth
monarch,
now
ascends
the
throne.
To
seize
immortal
fame,
his
mighty
mind,
(What
man
had
never
dar'd
before),
design'd;
That
glorious
labour
which
I
now
pursue,
Through
seas
unsail'd
to
find
the
shores
that
view
The
day-star,
rising
from
his
wat'ry
bed,
The
first
grey
beams
of
infant
morning
shed.
Selected
messengers
his
will
obey;
Through
Spain
and
France
they
hold
their
vent'rous
way.
Through
Italy
they
reach
the
port
that
gave
The
fair
Parthenope[315]
an
honour'd
grave;[316]
That
shore
which
oft
has
felt
the
servile
chain,
But,
now
smiles
happy
in
the
care
of
Spain.
Now,
from
the
port
the
brave
advent'rers
bore,
And
cut
the
billows
of
the
Rhodian
shore;
Now,
reach
the
strand
where
noble
Pompey[317]
bled;
And
now,
repair'd
with
rest,
to
Memphis
sped;
And
now,
ascending
by
the
vales
of
Nile,
(Whose
waves
pour
fatness
o'er
the
grateful
soil),
Through
Ethiopia's
peaceful
dales
they
stray,
Where
their
glad
eyes
Messiah's
rites[318]
survey:
And
now
they
pass
the
fam'd
Arabian
flood,
}
Whose
waves
of
old
in
wondrous
ridges
stood,
}
While
Israel's
favour'd
race
the
sable[319]
bottom
trod:
}
Behind
them,
glist'ning
to
the
morning
skies,
The
mountains
nam'd
from
Ishmael's
offspring[320]
rise;
Now,
round
their
steps
the
blest
Arabia
spreads
Her
groves
of
odour,
and
her
balmy
meads;
And
every
breast,
inspir'd
with
glee,
inhales
The
grateful
fragrance
of
Sabæa's
gales:
Now,
past
the
Persian
gulf
their
route
ascends
Where
Tigris'
wave
with
proud
Euphrates
blends;
Illustrious
streams,
where
still
the
native
shows
Where
Babel's
haughty
tower
unfinished
rose:
From
thence,
through
climes
unknown,
their
daring
course
Beyond
where
Trajan
forced
his
way,
they
force;[321]
Carmanian
hordes,
and
Indian
tribes
they
saw,
And
many
a
barb'rous
rite,
and
many
a
law[322]
Their
search
explor'd;
but,
to
their
native
shore,
Enrich'd
with
knowledge,
they
return'd
no
more.
The
glad
completion
of
the
fate's
decree,
Kind
Heaven
reserv'd,
Emmanuel,
for
thee.
The
crown,
and
high
ambition
of
thy[323]
sires,
To
thee
descending,
wak'd
thy
latent
fires,
And,
to
command
the
sea
from
pole
to
pole,
With
restless
wish
inflam'd
thy
mighty
soul.
Now,
from
the
sky,
the
sacred
light
withdrawn,
O'er
heaven's
clear
azure
shone
the
stars
of
dawn,
Deep
silence
spread
her
gloomy
wings
around,
And
human
griefs
were
wrapp'd
in
sleep
profound.
The
monarch
slumber'd
on
his
golden
bed,
Yet,
anxious
cares
possess'd
his
thoughtful
head;
His
gen'rous
soul,
intent
on
public
good,
The
glorious
duties
of
his
birth
review'd.
When,
sent
by
Heaven,
a
sacred
dream
inspir'd
His
lab'ring
mind,
and
with
its
radiance
fir'd:
High
to
the
clouds
his
tow'ring
head
was
rear'd,
New
worlds,
and
nations
fierce,
and
strange,
appear'd;
The
purple
dawning
o'er
the
mountains
flow'd,
The
forest-boughs
with
yellow
splendour
glow'd;
High,
from
the
steep,
two
copious
glassy
streams
Roll'd
down,
and
glitter'd
in
the
morning
beams;
Here,
various
monsters
of
the
wild
were
seen,
And
birds
of
plumage
azure,
scarlet,
green:
Here,
various
herbs,
and
flow'rs
of
various
bloom;
There,
black
as
night,
the
forest's
horrid
gloom,
Whose
shaggy
brakes,
by
human
step
untrod,
Darken'd
the
glaring
lion's
dread
abode.
Here,
as
the
monarch
fix'd
his
wond'ring
eyes,
Two
hoary
fathers
from
the
streams
arise;
Their
aspect
rustic,
yet,
a
reverend
grace
Appear'd
majestic
on
their
wrinkled
face:
Their
tawny
beards
uncomb'd,
and
sweepy
long,
Adown
their
knees
in
shaggy
ringlets
hung;
From
every
lock
the
crystal
drops
distil,
And
bathe
their
limbs,
as
in
a
trickling
rill;
Gay
wreaths
of
flowers,
of
fruitage,
and
of
boughs,
(Nameless
in
Europe),
crown'd
their
furrow'd
brows.
Bent
o'er
his
staff,
more
silver'd
o'er
with
years,
Worn
with
a
longer
way,
the
one
appears;
Who
now
slow
beck'ning
with
his
wither'd
hand,
As
now
advanc'd
before
the
king
they
stand:--
"O
thou,
whom
worlds
to
Europe
yet
unknown,
Are
doom'd
to
yield,
and
dignify
thy
crown;
To
thee
our
golden
shores
the
Fates
decree;
Our
necks,
unbow'd
before,
shall
bend
to
thee.
Wide
thro'
the
world
resounds
our
wealthy
fame;
Haste,
speed
thy
prows,
that
fated
wealth
to
claim.
From
Paradise
my
hallow'd
waters
spring;
The
sacred
Ganges
I,
my
brother
king
Th'
illustrious
author[324]
of
the
Indian
name:
Yet,
toil
shall
languish,
and
the
fight
shall
flame;
Our
fairest
lawns
with
streaming
gore
shall
smoke,
Ere
yet
our
shoulders
bend
beneath
the
yoke;
But,
thou
shalt
conquer:
all
thine
eyes
survey,
With
all
our
various
tribes,
shall
own
thy
sway."
He
spoke;
and,
melting
in
a
silv'ry
stream,
Both
disappear'd;
when
waking
from
his
dream,
The
wond'ring
monarch,
thrill'd
with
awe
divine,
Weighs
in
his
lofty
thoughts
the
sacred
sign.
Now,
morning
bursting
from
the
eastern
sky,
Spreads
o'er
the
clouds
the
blushing
rose's
dye,
The
nations
wake,
and,
at
the
sov'reign's
call,
The
Lusian
nobles
crowd
the
palace
hall.
The
vision
of
his
sleep
the
monarch
tells;
Each
heaving
breast
with
joyful
wonder
swells:
"Fulfil,"
they
cry:
"the
sacred
sign
obey;
And
spread
the
canvas
for
the
Indian
sea."
Instant
my
looks
with
troubled
ardour
burn'd,
When,
keen
on
me,
his
eyes
the
monarch
turn'd:
What
he
beheld
I
know
not,
but
I
know,
Big
swell'd
my
bosom
with
a
prophet's
glow:
And
long
my
mind,
with
wondrous
bodings
fir'd,
Had
to
the
glorious,
dreadful
toil
aspir'd:
Yet,
to
the
king,
whate'er
my
looks
betray'd,
My
looks
the
omen
of
success
display'd.
When
with
that
sweetness
in
his
mien
express'd,
Which,
unresisted,
wins
the
gen'rous
breast,
"Great
are
the
dangers,
great
the
toils,"
he
cried,
"Ere
glorious
honours
crown
the
victor's
pride.
If
in
the
glorious
strife
the
hero
fall,
He
proves
no
danger
could
his
soul
appal;
And,
but
to
dare
so
great
a
toil,
shall
raise
Each
age's
wonder,
and
immortal
praise.
For
this
dread
toil,
new
oceans
to
explore,
To
spread
the
sail
where
sail
ne'er
flow'd
before,
For
this
dread
labour,
to
your
valour
due,
From
all
your
peers
I
name,
O
VASCO,[325]
you.
Dread
as
it
is,
yet
light
the
task
shall
be
To
you
my
GAMA,
as
perform'd
for
me."
My
heart
could
bear
no
more:--"Let
skies
on
fire,
Let
frozen
seas,
let
horrid
war
conspire,
I
dare
them
all,"
I
cried,
"and,
but
repine
That
one
poor
life
is
all
I
can
resign.
Did
to
my
lot
Alcides'[326]
labours
fall,
For
you
my
joyful
heart
would
dare
them
all;
The
ghastly
realms
of
death,
could
man
invade,
For
you
my
steps
should
trace
the
ghastly
shade."
While
thus,
with
loyal
zeal,
my
bosom
swell'd,
That
panting
zeal
my
prince
with
joy
beheld:
Honour'd
with
gifts
I
stood,
but,
honour'd
more
By
that
esteem
my
joyful
sov'reign
bore.
That
gen'rous
praise
which
fires
the
soul
of
worth,
And
gives
new
virtues
unexpected
birth,
That
praise,
e'en
now,
my
heaving
bosom
fires,
Inflames
my
courage,
and
each
wish
inspires.
Mov'd
by
affection,
and
allur'd
by
fame,
A
gallant
youth,
who
bore
the
dearest
name,
Paulus,
my
brother,
boldly
su'd
to
share
My
toils,
my
dangers,
and
my
fate
in
war;
And,
brave
Coëllo
urg'd
the
hero's
claim
To
dare
each
hardship,
and
to
join
our
fame:
For
glory
both
with
restless
ardour
burn'd,
And
silken
ease
for
horrid
danger
spurn'd;
Alike
renown'd
in
council,
or
in
field,
The
snare
to
baffle,
or
the
sword
to
wield.
Through
Lisbon's
youth
the
kindling
ardour
ran,
And
bold
ambition
thrill'd
from
man
to
man;
And
each,
the
meanest
of
the
vent'rous
band,
With
gifts
stood
honour'd
by
the
sov'reign's
hand.
Heavens!
what
a
fury
swell'd
each
warrior's
breast,
When
each,
in
turn,
the
smiling
king
address'd!
Fir'd
by
his
words
the
direst
toils
they
scorn'd,
And,
with
the
horrid
lust
of
danger
fiercely
burn'd.
With
such
bold
rage
the
youth
of
Mynia
glow'd,
When
the
first
keel
the
Euxine
surges
plough'd;
When,
bravely
vent'rous
for
the
golden
fleece,
Orac'lous
Argo[327]
sail'd
from
wond'ring
Greece.
Where
Tago's
yellow
stream
the
harbour
laves,
And
slowly
mingles
with
the
ocean
waves,
In
warlike
pride,
my
gallant
navy
rode,
And,
proudly
o'er
the
beach
my
soldiers
strode.
Sailors
and
landsmen,
marshall'd
o'er
the
strand,
In
garbs
of
various
hue
around
me
stand;
Each
earnest,
first
to
plight
the
sacred
vow,
Oceans
unknown,
and
gulfs
untried
to
plough:
Then,
turning
to
the
ships
their
sparkling
eyes,
With
joy
they
heard
the
breathing
winds
arise;
Elate
with
joy,
beheld
the
flapping
sail,
And
purple
standards
floating
on
the
gale:
While
each
presag'd,
that
great
as
Argo's
fame,
Our
fleet
should
give
some
starry
band
a
name.
Where
foaming
on
the
shore
the
tide
appears,
A
sacred
fane
its
hoary
arches
rears:
Dim
o'er
the
sea
the
ev'ning
shades
descend,
And,
at
the
holy
shrine,
devout,
we
bend:
There,
while
the
tapers
o'er
the
altar
blaze,
Our
prayers,
and
earnest
vows
to
Heav'n
we
raise.
"Safe
through
the
deep,
where
every
yawning
wave
Still
to
the
sailor's
eye
displays
his
grave;
Thro'
howling
tempests,
and
thro'
gulfs
untried,
O
mighty
God!
be
thou
our
watchful
guide."
While
kneeling
thus,
before
the
sacred
shrine,
In
holy
faith's
most
solemn
rite
we
join;
Our
peace
with
Heav'n
the
bread
of
peace
confirms,
And
meek
contrition
ev'ry
bosom
warms:
Sudden,
the
lights
extinguish'd,
all
around
Dread
silence
reigns,
and
midnight-gloom
profound;
A
sacred
horror
pants
on
every
breath,
And
each
firm
breast
devotes
itself
to
death,
An
offer'd
sacrifice,
sworn
to
obey
My
nod,
and
follow
where
I
lead
the
way.
Now,
prostrate
round
the
hallow'd
shrine
we
lie,[328]
Till
rosy
morn
bespreads
the
eastern
sky;
Then,
breathing
fix'd
resolves,
my
daring
mates
March
to
the
ships,
while
pour'd
from
Lisbon's
gates,
Thousands
on
thousands
crowding,
press
along,
A
woful,
weeping,
melancholy
throng.
A
thousand
white-rob'd
priests
our
steps
attend,
And
prayers,
and
holy
vows
to
Heav'n
ascend;
A
scene
so
solemn,
and
the
tender
woe
Of
parting
friends,
constrain'd
my
tears
to
flow.
To
weigh
our
anchors
from
our
native
shore--
}
To
dare
new
oceans
never
dar'd
before--
}
Perhaps
to
see
my
native
coast
no
more--
}
Forgive,
O
king,
if
as
a
man
I
feel,
I
bear
no
bosom
of
obdurate
steel.----
(The
godlike
hero
here
suppress'd
the
sigh,
And
wip'd
the
tear-drop
from
his
manly
eye;
Then,
thus
resuming)--All
the
peopled
shore
An
awful,
silent
look
of
anguish
wore;
Affection,
friendship,
all
the
kindred
ties
Of
spouse
and
parent
languish'd
in
their
eyes:
As
men
they
never
should
again
behold,
Self-offer'd
victims
to
destruction
sold,
On
us
they
fix'd
the
eager
look
of
woe,
While
tears
o'er
ev'ry
cheek
began
to
flow;
When
thus
aloud,
"Alas!
my
son,
my
son,"
A
hoary
sire
exclaims,
"oh!
whither
run,
My
heart's
sole
joy,
my
trembling
age's
stay,
To
yield
thy
limbs
the
dread
sea-monster's
prey!
To
seek
thy
burial
in
the
raging
wave,
And
leave
me
cheerless
sinking
to
the
grave!
Was
it
for
this
I
watch'd
thy
tender
years,
And
bore
each
fever
of
a
father's
fears!
Alas,
my
boy!"--His
voice
is
heard
no
more,
The
female
shriek
resounds
along
the
shore:
With
hair
dishevell'd,
through
the
yielding
crowd
A
lovely
bride
springs
on,
and
screams
aloud;
"Oh!
where,
my
husband,
where
to
seas
unknown,
Where
wouldst
thou
fly,
me
and
my
love
disown!
And
wilt
thou,
cruel,
to
the
deep
consign
That
valued
life,
the
joy,
the
soul
of
mine!
And
must
our
loves,
and
all
the
kindred
train
Of
rapt
endearments,
all
expire
in
vain!
All
the
dear
transports
of
the
warm
embrace,
When
mutual
love
inspir'd
each
raptur'd
face!
Must
all,
alas!
be
scatter'd
in
the
wind,
Nor
thou
bestow
one
ling'ring
look
behind!"
Such,
the
'lorn
parents'
and
the
spouses'
woes,
Such,
o'er
the
strand
the
voice
of
wailing
rose;
From
breast
to
breast
the
soft
contagion
crept,
Moved
by
the
woful
sound
the
children
wept;
The
mountain-echoes
catch
the
big
swoll'n
sighs,
And,
through
the
dales,
prolong
the
matron's
cries;
The
yellow
sands
with
tears
are
silver'd
o'er,
Our
fate
the
mountains
and
the
beach
deplore.
Yet,
firm
we
march,
nor
turn
one
glance
aside
On
hoary
parent,
or
on
lovely
bride.
Though
glory
fir'd
our
hearts,
too
well
we
knew
What
soft
affection,
and
what
love
could
do.
The
last
embrace
the
bravest
worst
can
bear:
The
bitter
yearnings
of
the
parting
tear
Sullen
we
shun,
unable
to
sustain
The
melting
passion
of
such
tender
pain.
Now,
on
the
lofty
decks,
prepar'd,
we
stand,
When,
tow'ring
o'er
the
crowd
that
veil'd
the
strand,
A
reverend
figure[329]
fix'd
each
wond'ring
eye,
And,
beck'ning
thrice,
he
wav'd
his
hand
on
high,
And
thrice
his
hoary
curls
he
sternly
shook,
While
grief
and
anger
mingled
in
his
look;
Then,
to
its
height
his
falt'ring
voice
he
rear'd,
And
through
the
fleet
these
awful
words
were
heard:[330]
"O
frantic
thirst
of
honour
and
of
fame,
The
crowd's
blind
tribute,
a
fallacious
name;
What
stings,
what
plagues,
what
secret
scourges
curs'd,
Torment
those
bosoms
where
thy
pride
is
nurs'd!
What
dangers
threaten,
and
what
deaths
destroy
The
hapless
youth,
whom
thy
vain
gleams
decoy!
By
thee,
dire
tyrant
of
the
noble
mind,
What
dreadful
woes
are
pour'd
on
human
kind:
Kingdoms
and
empires
in
confusion
hurl'd,
What
streams
of
gore
have
drench'd
the
hapless
world!
Thou
dazzling
meteor,
vain
as
fleeting
air,
What
new-dread
horror
dost
thou
now
prepare!
High
sounds
thy
voice
of
India's
pearly
shore,
Of
endless
triumphs
and
of
countless
store:
Of
other
worlds
so
tower'd
thy
swelling
boast,
Thy
golden
dreams
when
Paradise
was
lost,
When
thy
big
promise
steep'd
the
world
in
gore,
And
simple
innocence
was
known
no
more.
And
say,
has
fame
so
dear,
so
dazzling
charms?
Must
brutal
fierceness,
and
the
trade
of
arms,
Conquest,
and
laurels
dipp'd
in
blood,
be
priz'd,
While
life
is
scorn'd,
and
all
its
joys
despis'd?
And
say,
does
zeal
for
holy
faith
inspire
To
spread
its
mandates,
thy
avow'd
desire?
Behold
the
Hagarene[331]
in
armour
stands,
Treads
on
thy
borders,
and
the
foe
demands:
A
thousand
cities
own
his
lordly
sway,
A
thousand
various
shores
his
nod
obey.
Through
all
these
regions,
all
these
cities,
scorn'd
Is
thy
religion,
and
thine
altars
spurn'd.
A
foe
renown'd
in
arms
the
brave
require;
That
high-plum'd
foe,
renown'd
for
martial
fire,
Before
thy
gates
his
shining
spear
displays,
Whilst
thou
wouldst
fondly
dare
the
wat'ry
maze,
Enfeebled
leave
thy
native
land
behind,
On
shores
unknown
a
foe
unknown
to
find.
Oh!
madness
of
ambition!
thus
to
dare
Dangers
so
fruitless,
so
remote
a
war!
That
Fame's
vain
flattery
may
thy
name
adorn,
And
thy
proud
titles
on
her
flag
be
borne:
Thee,
lord
of
Persia,
thee,
of
India
lord,
O'er
Ethiopia's
vast,
and
Araby
ador'd!
"Curs'd
be
the
man
who
first
on
floating
wood,
Forsook
the
beach,
and
braved
the
treach'rous
flood!
Oh!
never,
never
may
the
sacred
Nine,[332]
To
crown
his
brows,
the
hallow'd
wreath
entwine;
Nor
may
his
name
to
future
times
resound;
Oblivion
be
his
meed,
and
hell
profound!
Curs'd
be
the
wretch,
the
fire
of
heaven
who
stole,
And
with
ambition
first
debauch'd
the
soul!
What
woes,
Prometheus,[333]
walk
the
frighten'd
earth!
To
what
dread
slaughter
has
thy
pride
giv'n
birth!
On
proud
Ambition's
pleasing
gales
upborne,
One
boasts
to
guide
the
chariot
of
the
morn;
And
one
on
treach'rous
pinions
soaring
high,[334]
O'er
ocean's
waves
dar'd
sail
the
liquid
sky:
Dash'd
from
their
height
they
mourn'd
their
blighted
aim;
One
gives
a
river,
one
a
sea
the
name!
Alas!
the
poor
reward
of
that
gay
meteor,
fame!
Yet,
such
the
fury
of
the
mortal
race,
Though
fame's
fair
promise
ends
in
foul
disgrace,
Though
conquest
still
the
victor's
hope
betrays,
The
prize
a
shadow,
or
a
rainbow-blaze,
Yet,
still
through
fire
and
raging
seas
they
run
To
catch
the
gilded
shade,
and
sink
undone!"

THE

not

His

The
King

While
on
the
beach
the
hoary
father
stood,
And
spoke
the
murmurs
of
the
multitude,
We
spread
the
canvas
to
the
rising
gales,
The
gentle
winds
distend
the
snowy
sails.
As
from
our
dear-lov'd
native
shore
we
fly
Our
votive
shouts,
redoubled,
rend
the
sky;
"Success,
success!"
far
echoes
o'er
the
tide,
While
our
broad
hulks
the
foamy
waves
divide.
From
Leo[335]
now,
the
lordly
star
of
day,
Intensely
blazing,
shot
his
fiercest
ray;
When,
slowly
gliding
from
our
wishful
eyes,
The
Lusian
mountains
mingled
with
the
skies;
Tago's
lov'd
stream,
and
Cintra's[336]
mountains
cold
Dim
fading
now,
we
now
no
more
behold;
And,
still
with
yearning
hearts
our
eyes
explore,
Till
one
dim
speck
of
land
appears
no
more.
Our
native
soil
now
far
behind,
we
ply
The
lonely
dreary
waste
of
seas,
and
boundless
sky
Through
the
wild
deep
our
vent'rous
navy
bore,
Where
but
our
Henry
plough'd
the
wave
before;[337]
The
verdant
islands,
first
by
him
descried,
We
pass'd;
and,
now
in
prospect
op'ning
wide,
Far
to
the
left,
increasing
on
the
view,
Rose
Mauritania's[338]
hills
of
paly
blue:
Far
to
the
right
the
restless
ocean
roar'd,
Whose
bounding
surges
never
keel
explor'd:
If
bounding
shore
(as
reason
deems)
divide
The
vast
Atlantic
from
the
Indian
tide.[339]
Nam'd
from
her
woods,[340]
with
fragrant
bowers
adorn'd,
From
fair
Madeira's
purple
coast
we
turn'd:[340]
Cyprus
and
Paphos'
vales
the
smiling
loves
Might
leave
with
joy
for
fair
Madeira's
groves;
A
shore
so
flow'ry,
and
so
sweet
an
air,
Venus
might
build
her
dearest
temple
there.
Onward
we
pass
Massilia's
barren
strand,
A
waste
of
wither'd
grass
and
burning
sand;
Where
his
thin
herds
the
meagre
native
leads,
Where
not
a
riv'let
laves
the
doleful
meads;
Nor
herds,
nor
fruitage
deck
the
woodland
maze;
O'er
the
wild
waste
the
stupid
ostrich
strays,
In
devious
search
to
pick
her
scanty
meal,
Whose
fierce
digestion
gnaws
the
temper'd
steel.
From
the
green
verge,
where
Tigitania
ends,
To
Ethiopia's
line
the
dreary
wild
extends.
Now,
past
the
limit,
which
his
course
divides,[341]
When
to
the
north
the
sun's
bright
chariot
rides,
We
leave
the
winding
bays
and
swarthy
shores,
Where
Senegal's
black
wave
impetuous
roars;
A
flood,
whose
course
a
thousand
tribes
surveys,
The
tribes
who
blacken'd
in
the
fiery
blaze
When
Phaëton,
devious
from
the
solar
height,
Gave
Afric's
sons
the
sable
hue
of
night.
And
now,
from
far
the
Libyan
cape
is
seen,
Now
by
my
mandate
named
the
Cape
of
Green;[342]
Where,
midst
the
billows
of
the
ocean,
smiles
A
flow'ry
sister-train,
the
happy
isles,[343]
Our
onward
prows
the
murm'ring
surges
lave;
And
now,
our
vessels
plough
the
gentle
wave,
Where
the
blue
islands,
named
of
Hesper
old,
Their
fruitful
bosoms
to
the
deep
unfold.
Here,
changeful
Nature
shows
her
various
face,
And
frolics
o'er
the
slopes
with
wildest
grace:
Here,
our
bold
fleet
their
pond'rous
anchors
threw,
The
sickly
cherish,
and
our
stores
renew.
From
him,
the
warlike
guardian
pow'r
of
Spain,
Whose
spear's
dread
lightning
o'er
th'
embattled
plain
Has
oft
o'erwhelm'd
the
Moors
in
dire
dismay,
And
fix'd
the
fortune
of
the
doubtful
day;
From
him
we
name
our
station
of
repair,
And
Jago's
name
that
isle
shall
ever
bear.
The
northern
winds
now
curl'd
the
black'ning
main,
Our
sails
unfurl'd,
we
plough
the
tide
again:
Round
Afric's
coast
our
winding
course
we
steer,
Where,
bending
to
the
east,
the
shores
appear.
Here
Jalofo[344]
its
wide
extent
displays,
And
vast
Mandinga
shows
its
num'rous
bays;
Whose
mountains'
sides,
though
parch'd
and
barren,
hold,
In
copious
store,
the
seeds
of
beamy
gold.[345]
The
Gambia
here
his
serpent-journey
takes,
And,
thro'
the
lawns,
a
thousand
windings
makes;
A
thousand
swarthy
tribes
his
current
laves
Ere
mix
his
waters
with
th'
Atlantic
waves.
The
Gorgades
we
pass'd,
that
hated
shore,[346]
Fam'd
for
its
terrors
by
the
bards
of
yore;
Where
but
one
eye
by
Phorcus'
daughters
shar'd,
The
'lorn
beholders
into
marble
star'd;
Three
dreadful
sisters!
down
whose
temples
roll'd
Their
hair
of
snakes
in
many
a
hissing
fold,
And,
scatt'ring
horror
o'er
the
dreary
strand,
With
swarms
of
vipers
sow'd
the
burning
sand.
Still
to
the
south
our
pointed
keels
we
guide,
And,
thro'
the
austral
gulf,
still
onward
ride:
Her
palmy
forests
mingling
with
the
skies,
Leona's[347]
rugg'd
steep
behind
us
flies;
The
Cape
of
Palms[348]
that
jutting
land
we
name,
Already
conscious
of
our
nation's[349]
fame.
Where
the
vex'd
waves
against
our
bulwarks
roar,
And
Lusian
towers
o'erlook
the
bending
shore:
Our
sails
wide
swelling
to
the
constant
blast,
Now,
by
the
isle
from
Thomas
nam'd
we
pass'd;
And
Congo's
spacious
realm
before
us
rose,
Where
copious
Layra's
limpid
billow
flows;
A
flood
by
ancient
hero
never
seen,
Where
many
a
temple
o'er
the
banks
of
green,[350]
Rear'd
by
the
Lusian
heroes,
through
the
night
Of
pagan
darkness,
pours
the
mental
light.
O'er
the
wild
waves,
as
southward
thus
we
stray,
Our
port
unknown,
unknown
the
wat'ry
way,
Each
night
we
see,
impress'd
with
solemn
awe,
Our
guiding
stars,
and
native
skies
withdraw,
In
the
wide
void
we
lose
their
cheering
beams,
Lower
and
lower
still
the
pole-star
gleams.
Till
past
the
limit,
where
the
car
of
day
Roll'd
o'er
our
heads,
and
pour'd
the
downward
ray:
We
now
disprove
the
faith
of
ancient
lore;
Boötes
shining
car
appears
no
more.
For
here
we
saw
Calisto's[351]
star
retire
Beneath
the
waves,
unaw'd
by
Juno's
ire.
Here,
while
the
sun
his
polar
journeys
takes,
His
visit
doubled,
double
season
makes;
Stern
winter
twice
deforms
the
changeful
year,
And
twice
the
spring's
gay
flowers
their
honours
rear.
Now,
pressing
onward,
past
the
burning
zone,
Beneath
another
heaven
and
stars
unknown,
Unknown
to
heroes
and
to
sages
old,
With
southward
prows
our
pathless
course
we
hold:
Here,
gloomy
night
assumes
a
darker
reign,
And
fewer
stars
emblaze
the
heavenly
plain;
Fewer
than
those
that
gild
the
northern
pole,
And
o'er
our
seas
their
glitt'ring
chariots
roll:
While
nightly
thus,
the
lonely
seas
we
brave,
Another
pole-star[352]
rises
o'er
the
wave:
Full
to
the
south
a
shining
cross[353]
appears,
Our
heaving
breasts
the
blissful
omen
cheers:
Seven
radiant
stars
compose
the
hallow'd
sign
That
rose
still
higher
o'er
the
wavy
brine.
Beneath
this
southern
axle
of
the
world
Never,
with
daring
search,
was
flag
unfurl'd;
Nor
pilot
knows
if
bounding
shores
are
plac'd,
Or,
if
one
dreary
sea
o'erflow
the
lonely
waste.
While
thus
our
keels
still
onward
boldly
stray'd,
Now
toss'd
by
tempests,
now
by
calms
delay'd,
To
tell
the
terrors
of
the
deep
untried,
What
toils
we
suffer'd,
and
what
storms
defied;
What
rattling
deluges
the
black
clouds
pour'd,
What
dreary
weeks
of
solid
darkness
lower'd;
What
mountain-surges
mountain-surges
lash'd,
What
sudden
hurricanes
the
canvas
dash'd;
What
bursting
lightnings,
with
incessant
flare,
Kindled,
in
one
wide
flame,
the
burning
air;
What
roaring
thunders
bellow'd
o'er
our
head,
And
seem'd
to
shake
the
reeling
ocean's
bed:
To
tell
each
horror
on
the
deep
reveal'd,
Would
ask
an
iron
throat
with
tenfold
vigour
steel'd:[354]
Those
dreadful
wonders
of
the
deep
I
saw,
Which
fill
the
sailor's
breast
with
sacred
awe;
And
which
the
sages,
of
their
learning
vain,
Esteem
the
phantoms
of
the
dreamful
brain:
That
living
fire,
by
seamen
held
divine,[355]
Of
Heaven's
own
care
in
storms
the
holy
sign,
Which,
midst
the
horrors
of
the
tempest
plays,
And,
on
the
blast's
dark
wings
will
gaily
blaze;
These
eyes
distinct
have
seen
that
living
fire
Glide
through
the
storm,
and
round
my
sails
aspire.
And
oft,
while
wonder
thrill'd
my
breast,
mine
eyes
To
heaven
have
seen
the
wat'ry
columns
rise.
Slender,
at
first,
the
subtle
fume
appears,
And
writhing
round
and
round
its
volume
rears:
Thick
as
a
mast
the
vapour
swells
its
size,
A
curling
whirlwind
lifts
it
to
the
skies;
The
tube
now
straightens,
now
in
width
extends,
And,
in
a
hov'ring
cloud,
its
summit
ends:
Still,
gulp
on
gulp
in
sucks
the
rising
tide,
And
now
the
cloud,
with
cumbrous
weight
supplied,
Full-gorg'd,
and
black'ning,
spreads,
and
moves,
more
slow,
And
waving
trembles
to
the
waves
below.
Thus,
when
to
shun
the
summer's
sultry
beam
The
thirsty
heifer
seeks
the
cooling
stream,
The
eager
horse-leech
fixing
on
her
lips,
Her
blood
with
ardent
throat
insatiate
sips,
Till
the
gorg'd
glutton,
swell'd
beyond
her
size,
Drops
from
her
wounded
hold,
and
bursting,
dies.
So,
bursts
the
cloud,
o'erloaded
with
its
freight,
And
the
dash'd
ocean
staggers
with
the
weight.
But
say,
ye
sages,
who
can
weigh
the
cause,
And
trace
the
secret
springs
of
nature's
laws,
Say,
why
the
wave,
of
bitter
brine
erewhile,
Should
to
the
bosom
of
the
deep
recoil
Robb'd
of
its
salt,
and,
from
the
cloud
distil,
Sweet
as
the
waters
of
the
limpid[356]
rill?
Ye
sons
of
boastful
wisdom,
famed
of
yore,
Whose
feet
unwearied
wander'd
many
a
shore,
From
nature's
wonders
to
withdraw
the
veil,
Had
you
with
me
unfurl'd
the
daring
sail,
Had
view'd
the
wondrous
scenes
mine
eyes
survey'd,
What
seeming
miracles
the
deep
display'd,
What
secret
virtues
various
nature
show'd,
Oh!
heaven!
with
what
a
fire
your
page
had
glow'd!
And
now,
since
wand'ring
o'er
the
foamy
spray,
Our
brave
Armada
held
her
vent'rous
way,
Five
times
the
changeful
empress
of
the
night
Had
fill'd
her
shining
horns
with
silver
light,
When
sudden,
from
the
maintop's
airy
round,
"Land!
land!"
is
echoed.
At
the
joyful
sound,
Swift
to
the
crowded
decks
the
bounding
crew
On
wings
of
hope
and
flutt'ring
transport
flew,
And
each
strain'd
eye
with
aching
sight
explores
The
wide
horizon
of
the
eastern
shores:
As
thin
blue
clouds
the
mountain
summits
rise,
And
now,
the
lawns
salute
our
joyful
eyes;
Loud
through
the
fleet
the
echoing
shouts
prevail,
We
drop
the
anchor,
and
restrain
the
sail;
And
now,
descending
in
a
spacious
bay,
Wide
o'er
the
coast
the
vent'rous
soldiers
stray,
To
spy
the
wonders
of
the
savage
shore,
Where
stranger's
foot
had
never
trod
before.
I
and
my
pilots,
on
the
yellow
sand,
Explore
beneath
what
sky
the
shores
expand.
That
sage
device,
whose
wondrous
use
proclaims
Th'
immortal
honour
of
its
authors'[357]
names,
The
sun's
height
measured,
and
my
compass
scann'd,
The
painted
globe
of
ocean
and
of
land.
Here
we
perceiv'd
our
vent'rous
keels
had
past
Unharm'd
the
southern
tropic's
howling
blast;
And
now,
approach'd
dread
Neptune's
secret
reign,
Where
the
stern
power,
as
o'er
the
austral
main
He
rides,
wide
scatters
from
the
polar
star
Hail,
ice,
and
snow,
and
all
the
wintry
war.
While
thus
attentive
on
the
beach
we
stood,
My
soldiers,
hast'ning
from
the
upland
wood,
Right
to
the
shore
a
trembling
negro
brought,
Whom,
on
the
forest-height,
by
force
they
caught,
As,
distant
wander'd
from
the
cell
of
home,
He
suck'd
the
honey
from
the
porous
comb.
Horror
glar'd
in
his
look,
and
fear
extreme,
In
mien
more
wild
than
brutal
Polypheme:
No
word
of
rich
Arabia's
tongue[358]
he
knew,
No
sign
could
answer,
nor
our
gems
would
view:
From
garments
strip'd
with
shining
gold
he
turn'd,
The
starry
diamond
and
the
silver
spurn'd.
Straight
at
my
nod
are
worthless
trinkets
brought;
Round
beads
of
crystal,
as
a
bracelet
wrought,
A
cap
of
red,
and,
dangling
on
a
string,
Some
little
bells
of
brass
before
him
ring:
A
wide-mouth'd
laugh
confess'd
his
barb'rous
joy,
And,
both
his
hands
he
raised
to
grasp
the
toy.
Pleas'd
with
these
gifts,
we
set
the
savage
free,
Homeward
he
springs
away,
and
bounds
with
glee.
Soon
as
the
gleamy
streaks
of
purple
morn
The
lofty
forest's
topmost
boughs
adorn,
Down
the
steep
mountain's
side,
yet
hoar
with
dew,
A
naked
crowd,
and
black
as
night
their
hue,
Come
tripping
to
the
shore:
Their
wishful
eyes
Declare
what
tawdry
trifles
most
they
prize:
These
to
their
hopes
were
given,
and,
void
of
fear
(Mild
seem'd
their
manners,
and
their
looks
sincere),
A
bold
rash
youth,
ambitious
of
the
fame
Of
brave
adventurer,
Velosó
his
name,
Through
pathless
brakes
their
homeward
steps
attends,
And,
on
his
single
arm,
for
help
depends.
Long
was
his
stay:
my
earnest
eyes
explore,
When,
rushing
down
the
mountain
to
the
shore
I
mark'd
him;
terror
urged
his
rapid
strides,
And
soon
Coëllo's
skiff
the
wave
divides.
Yet,
ere
his
friends
advanc'd,
the
treach'rous
foe
Trod
on
his
latest
steps,
and
aim'd
the
blow.
Moved
by
the
danger
of
a
youth
so
brave,
Myself
now
snatch'd
an
oar,
and
sprung
to
save:
When
sudden,
black'ning
down
the
mountain's
height,
Another
crowd
pursu'd
his
panting
flight;
And,
soon
an
arrowy,
and
a
flinty
shower
Thick
o'er
our
heads
the
fierce
barbarians
pour.
Nor
pour'd
in
vain;
a
feather'd
arrow
stood
Fix'd[359]
in
my
leg,
and
drank
the
gushing
blood.
Vengeance,
as
sudden,
ev'ry
wound
repays,
Full
on
their
fronts
our
flashing
lightnings
blaze;
Their
shrieks
of
horror
instant
pierce
the
sky,
And,
wing'd
with
fear,
at
fullest
speed
they
fly.
Long
tracks
of
gore
their
scatter'd
flight
betray'd,
And
now,
Velosó
to
the
fleet
convey'd,
His
sportful
mates
his
brave
exploits
demand,
And
what
the
curious
wonders
of
the
land:
"Hard
was
the
hill
to
climb,
my
valiant
friend,
But
oh!
how
smooth
and
easy
to
descend!
Well
hast
thou
prov'd
thy
swiftness
for
the
chase,
And
shown
thy
matchless
merit
in
the
race!"
With
look
unmov'd
the
gallant
youth
replied,
"For
you,
my
friends,
my
fleetest
speed
was
tried;
'Twas
you
the
fierce
barbarians
meant
to
slay;
For
you
I
fear'd
the
fortune
of
the
day;
Your
danger
great
without
mine
aid
I
knew,
And,
swift
as
lightning,
to
your
rescue
flew."[360]
He
now
the
treason
of
the
foe
relates,
How,
soon
as
past
the
mountain's
upland
straits,
They
chang'd
the
colour
of
their
friendly
show,
And
force
forbade
his
steps
to
tread
below:
How,
down
the
coverts
of
the
steepy
brake
Their
lurking
stand
a
treach'rous
ambush
take;
On
us,
when
speeding
to
defend
his
flight,
To
rush,
and
plunge
us
in
the
shades
of
night;
Nor,
while
in
friendship,
would
their
lips
unfold
Where
India's
ocean
laved
the
orient
shores
of
gold.
Now,
prosp'rous
gales
the
bending
canvas
swell'd;
From
these
rude
shores
our
fearless
course
we
held:
Beneath
the
glist'ning
wave
the
god
of
day
Had
now
five
times
withdrawn
the
parting
ray,
When
o'er
the
prow
a
sudden
darkness
spread,
And,
slowly
floating
o'er
the
mast's
tall
head
A
black
cloud
hover'd:
nor
appear'd
from
far
The
moon's
pale
glimpse,
nor
faintly
twinkling
star;
So
deep
a
gloom
the
low'ring
vapour
cast,
Transfix'd
with
awe
the
bravest
stood
aghast.
Meanwhile,
a
hollow
bursting
roar
resounds,
As
when
hoarse
surges
lash
their
rocky
mounds;
Nor
had
the
black'ning
wave,
nor
frowning
heav'n
The
wonted
signs
of
gath'ring
tempest
giv'n.
Amaz'd
we
stood.
"O
thou,
our
fortune's
guide,
Avert
this
omen,
mighty
God!"
I
cried;
"Or,
through
forbidden
climes
adventurous
stray'd,
Have
we
the
secrets
of
the
deep
survey'd,
Which
these
wide
solitudes
of
seas
and
sky
Were
doom'd
to
hide
from
man's
unhallow'd
eye?
Whate'er
this
prodigy,
it
threatens
more
}
Than
midnight
tempests,
and
the
mingled
roar,
}
When
sea
and
sky
combine
to
rock
the
marble
shore."
}
I
spoke,
when
rising
through
the
darken'd
air,
Appall'd,
we
saw
a
hideous
phantom
glare;
High
and
enormous
o'er
the
flood
he
tower'd,
And
'thwart
our
way
with
sullen
aspect
lower'd:
An
earthy
paleness
o'er
his
cheeks
was
spread,
Erect
uprose
his
hairs
of
wither'd
red;
Writhing
to
speak,
his
sable
lips
disclose,
Sharp
and
disjoin'd,
his
gnashing
teeth's
blue
rows;
His
haggard
beard
flow'd
quiv'ring
on
the
wind,
Revenge
and
horror
in
his
mien
combin'd;
His
clouded
front,
by
with'ring
lightnings
scar'd,
The
inward
anguish
of
his
soul
declar'd.
His
red
eyes,
glowing
from
their
dusky
caves,
Shot
livid
fires:
far
echoing
o'er
the
waves
His
voice
resounded,
as
the
cavern'd
shore
With
hollow
groan
repeats
the
tempest's
roar.
Cold
gliding
horrors
thrill'd
each
hero's
breast,
Our
bristling
hair
and
tott'ring
knees
confess'd
Wild
dread,
the
while
with
visage
ghastly
wan,
His
black
lips
trembling,
thus
the
fiend
began:--[361]
"O
you,
the
boldest
of
the
nations,
fir'd
By
daring
pride,
by
lust
of
fame
inspir'd,
Who,
scornful
of
the
bow'rs
of
sweet
repose,
Through
these
my
waves
advance
your
fearless
prows,
Regardless
of
the
length'ning
wat'ry
way,
And
all
the
storms
that
own
my
sov'reign
sway,
Who,
mid
surrounding
rocks
and
shelves
explore
Where
never
hero
brav'd
my
rage
before;
Ye
sons
of
Lusus,
who
with
eyes
profane
Have
view'd
the
secrets
of
my
awful
reign,
Have
pass'd
the
bounds
which
jealous
Nature
drew
To
veil
her
secret
shrine
from
mortal
view;
Hear
from
my
lips
what
direful
woes
attend,
And,
bursting
soon,
shall
o'er
your
race
descend.
"With
every
bounding
keel
that
dares
my
rage,
Eternal
war
my
rocks
and
storms
shall
wage,
The
next
proud
fleet[362]
that
through
my
drear
domain,
With
daring
search
shall
hoist
the
streaming
vane,
That
gallant
navy,
by
my
whirlwinds
toss'd,
And
raging
seas,
shall
perish
on
my
coast:
Then
he,
who
first
my
secret
reign
descried,
A
naked
corpse,
wide
floating
o'er
the
tide,
Shall
drive----
Unless
my
heart's
full
raptures
fail,
O
Lusus!
oft
shalt
thou
thy
children
wail;
Each
year
thy
shipwreck'd
sons
shalt
thou
deplore,
Each
year
thy
sheeted
masts
shall
strew
my
shore.
"With
trophies
plum'd
behold
a
hero
come,[363]
Ye
dreary
wilds,
prepare
his
yawning
tomb.
Though
smiling
fortune
bless'd
his
youthful
morn,
Though
glory's
rays
his
laurell'd
brows
adorn,
Full
oft
though
he
beheld
with
sparkling
eye
The
Turkish
moons[364]
in
wild
confusion
fly,
While
he,
proud
victor,
thunder'd
in
the
rear,
All,
all
his
mighty
fame
shall
vanish
here.
Quiloa's
sons,
and
thine,
Mombaz,
shall
see
Their
conqueror
bend
his
laurell'd
head
to
me;
While,
proudly
mingling
with
the
tempest's
sound,
Their
shouts
of
joy
from
every
cliff
rebound.
"The
howling
blast,
ye
slumb'ring
storms
prepare,
A
youthful
lover,
and
his
beauteous
fair,
Triumphant
sail
from
India's
ravag'd
land;
His
evil
angel
leads
him
to
my
strand.
Through
the
torn
hulk
the
dashing
waves
shall
roar,
The
shatter'd
wrecks
shall
blacken
all
my
shore.
Themselves
escaped,
despoil'd
by
savage
hands,
Shall,
naked,
wander
o'er
the
burning
sands,
Spar'd
by
the
waves
far
deeper
woes
to
bear,
Woes,
e'en
by
me,
acknowledg'd
with
a
tear.
Their
infant
race,
the
promis'd
heirs
of
joy,
Shall
now,
no
more,
a
hundred
hands
employ;
By
cruel
want,
beneath
the
parents'
eye,
In
these
wide
wastes
their
infant
race
shall
die;
Through
dreary
wilds,
where
never
pilgrim
trod,
Where
caverns
yawn,
and
rocky
fragments
nod,
The
hapless
lover
and
his
bride
shall
stray,
By
night
unshelter'd,
and
forlorn
by
day.
In
vain
the
lover
o'er
the
trackless
plain
Shall
dart
his
eyes,
and
cheer
his
spouse
in
vain.
Her
tender
limbs,
and
breast
of
mountain
snow,
Where,
ne'er
before,
intruding
blast
might
blow,
Parch'd
by
the
sun,
and
shrivell'd
by
the
cold
Of
dewy
night,
shall
he,
fond
man,
behold.
Thus,
wand'ring
wide,
a
thousand
ills
o'erpast,
In
fond
embraces
they
shall
sink
at
last;
While
pitying
tears
their
dying
eyes
o'erflow,
And
the
last
sigh
shall
wail
each
other's
woe.[365]
"Some
few,
the
sad
companions
of
their
fate,
Shall
yet
survive,
protected
by
my
hate,
On
Tagus'
banks
the
dismal
tale
to
tell,
How,
blasted
by
my
frown,
your
heroes
fell."
He
paus'd,
in
act
still
further
to
disclose
A
long,
a
dreary
prophecy
of
woes:
When
springing
onward,
loud
my
voice
resounds,
And
midst
his
rage
the
threat'ning
shade
confounds.
"What
art
thou,
horrid
form,
that
rid'st
the
air?
By
Heaven's
eternal
light,
stern
fiend,
declare."
His
lips
he
writhes,
his
eyes
far
round
he
throws,
And,
from
his
breast,
deep
hollow
groans
arose,
Sternly
askance
he
stood:
with
wounded
pride
And
anguish
torn,
"In
me,
behold,"
he
cried,
While
dark-red
sparkles
from
his
eyeballs
roll'd,
"In
me
the
Spirit
of
the
Cape
behold,
That
rock,
by
you
the
Cape
of
Tempests
nam'd,
}
By
Neptune's
rage,
in
horrid
earthquakes
fram'd,
}
When
Jove's
red
bolts
o'er
Titan's
offspring
flam'd.
}
With
wide-stretch'd
piles
I
guard
the
pathless
strand,
And
Afric's
southern
mound,
unmov'd,
I
stand:
Nor
Roman
prow,
nor
daring
Tyrian
oar
Ere
dash'd
the
white
wave
foaming
to
my
shore;
Nor
Greece,
nor
Carthage
ever
spread
the
sail
On
these
my
seas,
to
catch
the
trading
gale.
You,
you
alone
have
dar'd
to
plough
my
main,
And,
with
the
human
voice,
disturb
my
lonesome
reign."
He
spoke,
and
deep
a
lengthen'd
sigh
he
drew,
A
doleful
sound,
and
vanish'd
from
the
view:
The
frighten'd
billows
gave
a
rolling
swell,
And,
distant
far,
prolong'd
the
dismal
yell,
Faint,
and
more
faint
the
howling
echoes
die,
And
the
black
cloud
dispersing,
leaves
the
sky.
High
to
the
angel-host,
whose
guardian
care
Had
ever
round
us
watch'd,
my
hands
I
rear,
And
Heaven's
dread
King
implore:
"As
o'er
our
head
The
fiend
dissolv'd,
an
empty
shadow
fled;
So
may
his
curses,
by
the
winds
of
heav'n,
Far
o'er
the
deep,
their
idle
sport,
be
driv'n!"----
With
sacred
horror
thrill'd,
Melinda's
lord
Held
up
the
eager
hand,
and
caught
the
word.
"Oh,
wondrous
faith
of
ancient
days,"
he
cries,
"Conceal'd
in
mystic
lore
and
dark
disguise!
Taught
by
their
sires,
our
hoary
fathers
tell,
On
these
rude
shores
a
giant-spectre
fell,
What
time,
from
heaven
the
rebel
band
were
thrown:[366]
And
oft
the
wand'ring
swain
has
heard
his
moan.
While
o'er
the
wave
the
clouded
moon
appears
To
hide
her
weeping
face,
his
voice
he
rears
O'er
the
wild
storm.
Deep
in
the
days
of
yore,
A
holy
pilgrim
trod
the
nightly
shore;
Stern
groans
he
heard;
by
ghostly
spells
controll'd,
His
fate,
mysterious,
thus
the
spectre
told:
'By
forceful
Titan's
warm
embrace
compress'd,
The
rock-ribb'd
mother,
Earth,
his
love
confess'd:
The
hundred-handed
giant[367]
at
a
birth,
And
me,
she
bore,
nor
slept
my
hopes
on
earth;
My
heart
avow'd,
my
sire's
ethereal
flame;
Great
Adamastor,
then,
my
dreaded
name.
In
my
bold
brother's
glorious
toils
engaged,
Tremendous
war
against
the
gods
I
waged:
Yet,
not
to
reach
the
throne
of
heaven
I
try,
With
mountain
pil'd
on
mountain
to
the
sky;
To
me
the
conquest
of
the
seas
befel,
In
his
green
realm
the
second
Jove
to
quell.
Nor
did
ambition
all
my
passions
hold,
'Twas
love
that
prompted
an
attempt
so
bold.
Ah
me,
one
summer
in
the
cool
of
day,
I
saw
the
Nereids
on
the
sandy
bay,
With
lovely
Thetis
from
the
wave,
advance
In
mirthful
frolic,
and
the
naked
dance.
In
all
her
charms
reveal'd
the
goddess
trod,
With
fiercest
fires
my
struggling
bosom
glow'd;
Yet,
yet
I
feel
them
burning
in
my
heart,
And
hopeless,
languish
with
the
raging
smart.
For
her,
each
goddess
of
the
heavens
I
scorn'd,
For
her
alone
my
fervent
ardour
burn'd.
In
vain
I
woo'd
her
to
the
lover's
bed,
From
my
grim
form,
with
horror,
mute
she
fled.
Madd'ning
with
love,
by
force
I
ween
to
gain
The
silver
goddess
of
the
blue
domain;
To
the
hoar
mother
of
the
Nereid
band[368]
I
tell
my
purpose,
and
her
aid
command:
By
fear
impell'd,
old
Doris
tries
to
move,
And,
win
the
spouse
of
Peleus
to
my
love.
The
silver
goddess
with
a
smile
replies,
"What
nymph
can
yield
her
charms
a
giant's
prize!
Yet,
from
the
horrors
of
a
war
to
save,
And
guard
in
peace
our
empire
of
the
wave,
Whate'er
with
honour
he
may
hope
to
gain,
That,
let
him
hope
his
wish
shall
soon
attain."
The
promis'd
grace
infus'd
a
bolder
fire,
And
shook
my
mighty
limbs
with
fierce
desire.
But
ah,
what
error
spreads
its
dreadful
night,
What
phantoms
hover
o'er
the
lover's
sight!
The
war
resign'd,
my
steps
by
Doris
led,
While
gentle
eve
her
shadowy
mantle
spread,
Before
my
steps
the
snowy
Thetis
shone
In
all
her
charms,
all
naked,
and
alone.
Swift
as
the
wind
with
open
arms
I
sprung,
And,
round
her
waist
with
joy
delirious
clung:
In
all
the
transports
of
the
warm
embrace,
A
hundred
kisses
on
her
angel
face,
On
all
its
various
charms
my
rage
bestows,
And,
on
her
cheek,
my
cheek
enraptur'd
glows.
When,
oh,
what
anguish
while
my
shame
I
tell!
What
fix'd
despair,
what
rage
my
bosom
swell!
Here
was
no
goddess,
here
no
heav'nly
charms,
A
rugged
mountain
fill'd
my
eager
arms,
Whose
rocky
top,
o'erhung
with
matted
brier,
Receiv'd
the
kisses
of
my
am'rous
fire.
Wak'd
from
my
dream,
cold
horror
freez'd
my
blood;
Fix'd
as
a
rock,
before
the
rock
I
stood;
"O
fairest
goddess
of
the
ocean
train,
Behold
the
triumph
of
thy
proud
disdain;
Yet
why,"
I
cried,
"with
all
I
wish'd
decoy,
And,
when
exulting
in
the
dream
of
joy,
A
horrid
mountain
to
mine
arms
convey!"
Madd'ning
I
spoke,
and
furious,
sprung
away.
Far
to
the
south
I
sought
the
world
unknown,
Where
I,
unheard,
unscorn'd,
might
wail
alone,
My
foul
dishonour,
and
my
tears
to
hide,
And
shun
the
triumph
of
the
goddess'
pride.
My
brothers,
now,
by
Jove's
red
arm
o'erthrown,
Beneath
huge
mountains,
pil'd
on
mountains
groan;
And
I,
who
taught
each
echo
to
deplore,
And
tell
my
sorrows
to
the
desert
shore,
I
felt
the
hand
of
Jove
my
crimes
pursue,
My
stiff'ning
flesh
to
earthy
ridges
grew,
And
my
huge
bones,
no
more
by
marrow
warm'd,
To
horrid
piles,
and
ribs
of
rock
transform'd,
Yon
dark-brow'd
cape
of
monstrous
size
became,
Where,
round
me
still,
in
triumph
o'er
my
shame,
The
silv'ry
Thetis
bids
her
surges
roar,
And
waft
my
groans
along
the
dreary
shore.'"----
Melinda's
monarch
thus
the
tale
pursu'd,
Of
ancient
faith,
and
GAMA
thus
renew'd:--
Now,
from
the
wave
the
chariot
of
the
day,
Whirl'd
by
the
fiery
coursers,
springs
away,
When,
full
in
view,
the
giant
Cape
appears,
Wide
spreads
its
limbs,
and
high
its
shoulders
rears;
Behind
us,
now,
it
curves
the
bending
side,
And
our
bold
vessels
plough
the
eastern
tide.
Nor
long
excursive
off
at
sea
we
stand,
A
cultur'd
shore
invites
us
to
the
land.
Here
their
sweet
scenes
the
rural
joys
bestow,
And
give
our
wearied
minds
a
lively
glow.[369]
The
tenants
of
the
coast,
a
festive
band,
With
dances
meet
us
on
the
yellow
sand;
Their
brides
on
slow-pac'd
oxen
rode
behind;
The
spreading
horns
with
flow'ry
garlands
twin'd,
Bespoke
the
dew-lapp'd
beeves
their
proudest
boast,
Of
all
their
bestial
store
they
valued
most.
By
turns
the
husbands,
and
the
brides,
prolong
The
various
measures
of
the
rural
song.
Now,
to
the
dance
the
rustic
reeds
resound;
The
dancers'
heels,
light-quiv'ring,
beat
the
ground;
And
now,
the
lambs
around
them
bleating
stray,
Feed
from
their
hands,
or,
round
them
frisking
play.
Methought
I
saw
the
sylvan
reign
of
Pan,
And
heard
the
music
of
the
Mantuan
swan:[370]
With
smiles
we
hail
them,
and
with
joy
behold
The
blissful
manners
of
the
age
of
gold.
With
that
mild
kindness,
by
their
looks
display'd,
Fresh
stores
they
bring,
with
cloth
of
red
repaid;
Yet,
from
their
lips
no
word
we
knew
could
flow,
Nor
sign
of
India's
strand
their
hands
bestow.
Fair
blow
the
winds;
again
with
sails
unfurl'd
We
dare
the
main,
and
seek
the
eastern
world.
Now,
round
black
Afric's
coast
our
navy
veer'd,
And,
to
the
world's
mid
circle,
northward
steer'd:
The
southern
pole
low
to
the
wave
declin'd,
We
leave
the
isle
of
Holy
Cross[371]
behind:
That
isle
where
erst
a
Lusian,
when
he
pass'd
The
tempest-beaten
cape,
his
anchors
cast,
And
own'd
his
proud
ambition
to
explore
The
kingdoms
of
the
morn
could
dare
no
more.
From
thence,
still
on,
our
daring
course
we
hold
Thro'
trackless
gulfs,
whose
billows
never
roll'd
Around
the
vessel's
pitchy
sides
before;
Thro'
trackless
gulfs,
where
mountain
surges
roar,
For
many
a
night,
when
not
a
star
appear'd,
Nor
infant
moon's
dim
horns
the
darkness
cheer'd;
For
many
a
dreary
night,
and
cheerless
day,
}
In
calms
now
fetter'd,
now
the
whirlwind's
play,
}
By
ardent
hope
still
fir'd,
we
forc'd
our
dreadful
way.
}
Now,
smooth
as
glass
the
shining
waters
lie,
No
cloud,
slow
moving,
sails
the
azure
sky;
Slack
from
their
height
the
sails
unmov'd
decline,
The
airy
streamers
form
the
downward
line;
No
gentle
quiver
owns
the
gentle
gale,
Nor
gentlest
swell
distends
the
ready
sail;
Fix'd
as
in
ice,
the
slumb'ring
prows
remain,
And
silence
wide
extends
her
solemn
reign.
Now
to
the
waves
the
bursting
clouds
descend,
And
heaven
and
sea
in
meeting
tempests
blend;
The
black-wing'd
whirlwinds
o'er
the
ocean
sweep,
And
from
his
bottom
roars
the
stagg'ring
deep.
Driv'n
by
the
yelling
blast's
impetuous
sway
Stagg'ring
we
bound,
yet
onward
bound
away:
And
now,
escaped
the
fury
of
the
storm,
New
danger
threatens
in
a
various
form;
Though
fresh
the
breeze
the
swelling
canvas
swell'd,
A
current's
headlong
sweep
our
prows
withheld:
The
rapid
force
impress'd
on
every
keel,
Backward,
o'erpower'd,
our
rolling
vessels
reel:
When
from
their
southern
caves
the
winds,
enraged,
In
horrid
conflict
with
the
waves
engaged;
Beneath
the
tempest
groans
each
loaded
mast,
And,
o'er
the
rushing
tide
our
bounding
navy
pass'd.[372]
Now
shin'd
the
sacred
morn,
when
from
the
east
Three
kings[373]
the
holy
cradled
Babe
address'd,
And
hail'd
him
Lord
of
heaven:
that
festive
day[374]
We
drop
our
anchors
in
an
opening
bay;
The
river
from
the
sacred
day
we
name,[375]
And
stores,
the
wand'ring
seaman's
right,
we
claim:
Stores
we
receiv'd;
our
dearest
hope
in
vain,
No
word
they
utter'd
could
our
ears
retain;
Nought
to
reward
our
search
for
India's
sound,
By
word
or
sign
our
ardent
wishes
crown'd.[376]
Behold,
O
king,
how
many
a
shore
we
tried!
How
many
a
fierce
barbarian's
rage
defied!
Yet
still,
in
vain,
for
India's
shore
we
try,
The
long-sought
shores
our
anxious
search
defy.
Beneath
new
heavens,
where
not
a
star
we
knew,
Through
changing
climes,
where
poison'd
air
we
drew;
Wandering
new
seas,
in
gulfs
unknown,
forlorn,
By
labour
weaken'd,
and
by
famine
worn;
Our
food
corrupted,
pregnant
with
disease,
And
pestilence
on
each
expected
breeze;
Not
even
a
gleam
of
hope's
delusive
ray
To
lead
us
onward
through
the
devious
way--
That
kind
delusion[377]
which
full
oft
has
cheer'd
The
bravest
minds,
till
glad
success
appear'd;
Worn
as
we
were,
each
night
with
dreary
care,
Each
day,
with
danger
that
increas'd
despair;
Oh
!
monarch,
judge,
what
less
than
Lusian
fire
Could
still
the
hopeless
scorn
of
fate
inspire!
What
less,
O
king,
than
Lusian
faith
withstand,
When
dire
despair
and
famine
gave
command
Their
chief
to
murder,
and
with
lawless
power
Sweep
Afric's
seas,
and
every
coast
devour!
What
more
than
men
in
wild
despair
still
bold!
Those,
more
than
men,
in
these
my
band
behold!
Sacred
to
death,
by
death
alone
subdued,
These,
all
the
rage
of
fierce
despair
withstood;[378]
Firm
to
their
faith,
though
fondest
hope
no
more
Could
give
the
promise
of
their
native
shore!
Now,
the
sweet
waters
of
the
stream
we
leave,
And
the
salt
waves
our
gliding
prows
receive:
Here
to
the
left,
between
the
bending
shores,
Torn
by
the
winds
the
whirling
billow
roars;
And
boiling
raves
against
the
sounding
coast,
Whose
mines
of
gold
Sofala's
merchants
boast:
Full
to
the
gulf
the
show'ry
south-winds
howl,
Aslant,
against
the
wind,
our
vessels
roll:
Far
from
the
land,
wide
o'er
the
ocean
driv'n,
Our
helms
resigning
to
the
care
of
heav'n,
By
hope
and
fear's
keen
passions
toss'd,
we
roam,
When
our
glad
eyes
beheld
the
surges
foam
Against
the
beacons
of
a
cultur'd
bay,
Where
sloops
and
barges
cut
the
wat'ry
way.
The
river's
opening
breast
some
upward
plied,
And
some
came
gliding
down
the
sweepy
tide.
Quick
throbs
of
transport
heav'd
in
every
heart
To
view
the
knowledge
of
the
seaman's
art;
For
here,
we
hop'd
our
ardent
wish
to
gain,
To
hear
of
India's
strand,
nor
hop'd
in
vain.
Though
Ethiopia's
sable
hue
they
bore
No
look
of
wild
surprise
the
natives
wore:
Wide
o'er
their
heads
the
cotton
turban
swell'd,
And
cloth
of
blue
the
decent
loins
conceal'd.
Their
speech,
though
rude
and
dissonant
of
sound,
Their
speech
a
mixture
of
Arabian
own'd.
Fernando,
skill'd
in
all
the
copious
store
Of
fair
Arabia's
speech,
and
flow'ry
lore,
In
joyful
converse
heard
the
pleasing
tale,
That,
o'er
these
seas,
full
oft,
the
frequent
sail,
And
lordly
vessels,
tall
as
ours,
appear'd,
Which,
to
the
regions
of
the
morning
steer'd,
And,
back
returning,
to
the
southmost
land
Convey'd
the
treasures
of
the
Indian
strand;
Whose
cheerful
crews,
resembling
ours,
display
The
kindred
face
and
colour
of
the
day.[379]
Elate
with
joy
we
raise
the
glad
acclaim,
And,
"River
of
good
signs,"[380]
the
port
we
name:
Then,
sacred
to
the
angel
guide,[381]
who
led
The
young
Tobiah
to
the
spousal
bed,
And
safe
return'd
him
through
the
perilous
way,
We
rear
a
column[382]
on
the
friendly
bay.
Our
keels,
that
now
had
steer'd
through
many
a
clime,
By
shell-fish
roughen'd,
and
incased
with
slime,
Joyful
we
clean,
while
bleating
from
the
field
The
fleecy
dams
the
smiling
natives
yield:
But
while
each
face
an
honest
welcome
shows,
And,
big
with
sprightly
hope,
each
bosom
glows,
(Alas!
how
vain
the
bloom
of
human
joy!
How
soon
the
blasts
of
woe
that
bloom
destroy!)
A
dread
disease
its
rankling
horrors
shed,
And
death's
dire
ravage
through
mine
army
spread.
Never
mine
eyes
such
dreary
sight
beheld,
Ghastly
the
mouth
and
gums
enormous
swell'd;[383]
And
instant,
putrid
like
a
dead
man's
wound,
Poisoned
with
fœtid
steams
the
air
around.
No
sage
physician's
ever-watchful
zeal,
No
skilful
surgeon's
gentle
hand
to
heal,
Were
found:
each
dreary
mournful
hour
we
gave
Some
brave
companion
to
a
foreign
grave.
A
grave,
the
awful
gift
of
every
shore!----
Alas!
what
weary
toils
with
us
they
bore!
Long,
long
endear'd
by
fellowship
in
woe,
O'er
their
cold
dust
we
give
the
tears
to
flow;
And,
in
their
hapless
lot
forbode
our
own,
A
foreign
burial,
and
a
grave
unknown!
Now,
deeply
yearning
o'er
our
deathful
fate,
With
joyful
hope
of
India's
shore
elate,
We
loose
the
hawsers
and
the
sail
expand,
And,
upward
coast
the
Ethiopian
strand.
What
danger
threaten'd
at
Quiloa's
isle,
Mozambique's
treason,
and
Mombassa's
guile:
What
miracles
kind
Heav'n
our
guardian
wrought,
Loud
fame
already
to
thine
ears
has
brought:
Kind
Heaven
again
that
guardian
care
display'd,
And,
to
thy
port
our
weary
fleet
convey'd,
Where
thou,
O
king,
Heaven's
regent
power
below,
Bidd'st
thy
full
bounty
and
thy
truth
to
flow;
Health
to
the
sick,
and
to
the
weary
rest,
And
sprightly
hope
reviv'd
in
every
breast,
Proclaim
thy
gifts,
with
grateful
joy
repaid,
The
brave
man's
tribute
for
the
brave
man's
aid.
And
now,
in
honour
of
thy
fond
command,
The
glorious
annals
of
my
native
land;
And
what
the
perils
of
a
route
so
bold,
So
dread
as
ours,
my
faithful
lips
have
told.
Then
judge,
great
monarch,
if
the
world
before
Ere
saw
the
prow
such
length
of
seas
explore!
Nor
sage
Ulysses,[384]
nor
the
Trojan[385]
pride
Such
raging
gulfs,
such
whirling
storms
defied;
Nor
one
poor
tenth
of
my
dread
course
explor'd,
Though
by
the
muse
as
demigods
ador'd.
O
thou
whose
breast
all
Helicon
inflam'd,[386]
Whose
birth
seven
vaunting
cities
proudly
claim'd;
And
thou
whose
mellow
lute
and
rural
song,[387]
In
softest
flow,
led
Mincio's
waves
along,
Whose
warlike
numbers,
as
a
storm
impell'd,
And
Tiber's
surges
o'er
his
borders
swell'd;
Let
all
Parnassus
lend
creative
fire,
And
all
the
Nine[388]
with
all
their
warmth
inspire;
Your
demigods
conduct
through
every
scene
Cold
fear
can
paint,
or
wildest
fancy
feign;
The
Syren's
guileful
lay,
dire
Circe's
spell,[389]
And
all
the
horrors
of
the
Cyclop's
cell;[390]
Bid
Scylla's
barking
waves
their
mates
o'erwhelm
And
hurl
the
guardian
pilot
from
the
helm,[391]
Give
sails
and
oars
to
fly
the
purple
shore,
Where
love
of
absent
friend
awakes
no
more;[392]
In
all
their
charms
display
Calypso's
smiles,
Her
flow'ry
arbours
and
her
am'rous
wiles;
In
skins
confin'd
the
blust'ring
winds
control,[393]
Or,
o'er
the
feast
bid
loathsome
harpies[394]
prowl;
And
lead
your
heroes
through
the
dread
abodes
Of
tortur'd
spectres
and
infernal[395]
gods;
Give
ev'ry
flow'r
that
decks
Aonia's
hill
To
grace
your
fables
with
divinest
skill;
Beneath
the
wonders
of
my
tale
they
fall,
Where
truth,
all
unadorn'd
and
pure,
exceeds
them
all.----
While
thus,
illustrious
GAMA
charm'd
their
ears,
The
look
of
wonder
each
Melindian
wears,
And
pleased
attention
witness'd
the
command
Of
every
movement
of
his
lips,
or
hand.
The
king,
enraptur'd,
own'd
the
glorious
fame
Of
Lisbon's
monarchs
and
the
Lusian
name;
What
warlike
rage
the
victor-kings
inspir'd!
Nor
less
their
warriors'
loyal
faith
admir'd.
Nor
less
his
menial
train,
in
wonder
lost,
Repeat
the
gallant
deeds
that
please
them
most,
Each
to
his
mate;
while,
fix'd
in
fond
amaze,
The
Lusian
features
every
eye
surveys;
While,
present
to
the
view,
by
fancy
brought,
Arise
the
wonders
by
the
Lusians
wrought,
And
each
bold
feature
to
their
wond'ring
sight
Displays
the
raptur'd
ardour
of
the
fight.
Apollo
now
withdrew
the
cheerful
day,
And
left
the
western
sky
to
twilight
grey;
Beneath
the
wave
he
sought
fair
Thetis'
bed,
And,
to
the
shore
Melinda's
sov'reign
sped.
What
boundless
joys
are
thine,
O
just
Renown,
Thou
hope
of
Virtue,
and
her
noblest
crown!
By
thee
the
seeds
of
conscious
worth
are
fir'd,
Hero
by
hero,
fame
by
fame
inspir'd:
Without
thine
aid
how
soon
the
hero
dies!
By
thee
upborne,
his
name
ascends
the
skies.
This
Ammon[396]
knew,
and
own'd
his
Homer's
lyre
The
noblest
glory
of
Pelides'
ire.[397]
This
knew
Augustus,
and
from
Mantua's
shade
To
courtly
ease
the
Roman
bard
convey'd;[398]
And
soon
exulting
flow'd
the
song
divine,
The
noblest
glory
of
the
Roman
line.
Dear
was
the
Muse
to
Julius;
ever
dear
To
Scipio,
though
the
pond'rous,
conquering
spear
Roughen'd
his
hand,
th'
immortal
pen
he
knew,
And,
to
the
tented
field
the
gentle
Muses
drew.
Each
glorious
chief
of
Greek
or
Latian
line,
Or
barb'rous
race,
adorn'd
the
Aonian
shrine;
Each
glorious
name,
e'er
to
the
Muse
endear'd.
Or
woo'd
the
Muses,
or,
the
Muse
rever'd.
Alas,
on
Tago's
hapless
shores
alone
The
Muse
is
slighted,
and
her
charms
unknown;
For
this,
no
Virgil
here
attunes
the
lyre,
No
Homer
here
awakes
the
hero's
fire.
On
Tago's
shores
are
Scipios,
Cæsars
born,
And
Alexanders
Lisbon's
clime
adorn;
But,
Heaven
has
stamp'd
them
in
a
rougher
mould,
Nor
gave
the
polish
to
their
genuine
gold.
Careless
and
rude,
or
to
be
known
or
know,
In
vain,
to
them,
the
sweetest
numbers
flow:
Unheard,
in
vain
their
native
poet
sings,
And
cold
neglect
weighs
down
the
Muse's
wings,
Ev'n
he
whose
veins
the
blood
of
GAMA
warms,[399]
Walks
by,
unconscious
of
the
Muse's
charms:
For
him
no
Muse
shall
leave
her
golden
loom,
No
palm
shall
blossom,
and
no
wreath
shall
bloom:
Yet,
shall
my
labours
and
my
cares
be
paid
By
fame
immortal,
and
by
GAMA'S
shade:
Him
shall
the
song
on
ev'ry
shore
proclaim,
The
first
of
heroes,
first
of
naval
fame.
Rude,
and
ungrateful,
though
my
country
be,
This
proud
example
shall
be
taught
by
me--
"Where'er
the
hero's
worth
demands
the
skies,
To
crown
that
worth
some
gen'rous
bard
shall
rise!"

THE
FIFTH
BOOK.
BOOK
VI.
THE
ARGUMENT.
Gama's
long
recital
being
concluded,
the
poet
resumes
the
thread
of
his
story
in
his
own
person.
The
Portuguese
admiral
enters
into
an
alliance
with
the
King
of
Melinda,
assures
him
that
the
vessels
of
his
nation
will
always
in
future
anchor
on
his
shores.
Gama
receives
from
the
monarch
a
faithful
pilot
to
conduct
him
to
India.
Bacchus
now
has
recourse
to
Neptune,
at
whose
palace
the
divinities
of
the
sea
assemble.
The
gods
of
the
sea
consent
to
let
loose
the
winds
and
waves
against
the
daring
navigators.
During
the
night
the
sailors
on
the
watch
relate
to
each
other
amusing
stories.
Veloso
urges
them
to
relate
some
proud
feats
of
war.
The
history
of
the
contest
of
the
twelve
knights
of
England
with
the
twelve
of
Portugal
is
then
told.
A
violent
tempest
assails
the
fleet.
Vivid
picture
of
a
storm
at
sea.
Gama
addresses
his
prayer
to
God;
and
Venus,
with
her
nymphs
so
captivates
the
storm-gods
that
a
calm
ensues.
The
boy
at
the
mast-head
raises
a
joyful
cry
of
Land!
re-echoed
by
the
whole
crew.
The
pilot
informs
the
Portuguese
that
they
are
now
approaching
the
kingdom
of
Calicut.
The
poet's
reflections.
With
heart
sincere
the
royal
pagan
joy'd,
And
hospitable
rites
each
hour
employ'd,
For
much
the
king
the
Lusian
band
admir'd,
And,
much
their
friendship
and
their
aid
desir'd;
Each
hour
the
gay
festivity
prolongs,
Melindian
dances,
and
Arabian
songs;
Each
hour
in
mirthful
transport
steals
away,
By
night
the
banquet,
and
the
chase
by
day;
And
now,
the
bosom
of
the
deep
invites,
And
all
the
pride
of
Neptune's
festive
rites;
Their
silken
banners
waving
o'er
the
tide,
A
jovial
band,
the
painted
galleys
ride;
The
net
and
angle
various
hands
employ,
And
Moorish
timbrels
sound
the
notes
of
joy.
Such
was
the
pomp,
when
Egypt's
beauteous[400]
queen
Bade
all
the
pride
of
naval
show
convene,
In
pleasure's
downy
bosom,
to
beguile
Her
love-sick
warrior:[401]
o'er
the
breast
of
Nile,
Dazzling
with
gold,
the
purple
ensigns
flow'd,
And
to
the
lute
the
gilded
barges
row'd;
While
from
the
wave,
of
many
a
shining
hue,
The
anglers'
lines
the
panting
fishes
drew.
Now,
from
the
West
the
sounding
breezes
blow,
And
far
the
hoary
flood
was
yet
to
plough:
The
fountain
and
the
field
bestow'd
their
store,
And
friendly
pilots
from
the
friendly
shore,
Train'd
in
the
Indian
deep,
were
now
aboard,
When
GAMA,
parting
from
Melinda's
lord,
The
holy
vows
of
lasting
peace
renew'd,
For,
still
the
king
for
lasting
friendship
sued;
That
Lusus'
heroes
in
his
port
supplied,
And
tasted
rest,
he
own'd
his
dearest
pride,
And
vow'd,
that
ever
while
the
seas
they
roam,
The
Lusian
fleets
should
find
a
bounteous
home,
And,
ever
from
the
gen'rous
shore
receive
Whate'er
his
port,
whate'er
his
land
could
give.[402]
Nor
less
his
joy
the
grateful
chief
declar'd;
And
now,
to
seize
the
valued
hours
prepar'd.
Full
to
the
wind
the
swelling
sails
he
gave,
And,
his
red
prows
divide
the
foamy
wave:
Full
to
the
rising
sun
the
pilot
steers,
And,
far
from
shore
through
middle
ocean
bears.
The
vaulted
sky
now
widens
o'er
their
heads,
Where
first
the
infant
morn
his
radiance
sheds.
And
now,
with
transport
sparkling
in
his
eyes,
Keen
to
behold
the
Indian
mountains
rise,
High
on
the
decks
each
Lusian
hero
smiles,
And,
proudly
in
his
thoughts
reviews
his
toils.
When
the
stern
demon,
burning
with
disdain,
Beheld
the
fleet
triumphant
plough
the
main:
The
powers
of
heav'n,
and
heav'n's
dread
lord
he
knew,
Resolv'd
in
Lisbon
glorious
to
renew
The
Roman
honours--raging
with
despair
From
high
Olympus'
brow
he
cleaves
the
air,
On
earth
new
hopes
of
vengeance
to
devise,
And
sue
that
aid
denied
him
in
the
skies;
Blaspheming
Heav'n,
he
pierc'd
the
dread
abode
Of
ocean's
lord,
and
sought
the
ocean's
god.
Deep,
where
the
bases
of
the
hills
extend,
And
earth's
huge
ribs
of
rock
enormous
bend,
Where,
roaring
through
the
caverns,
roll
the
waves
Responsive
as
the
aërial
tempest
raves,
The
ocean's
monarch,
by
the
Nereid
train,
And
wat'ry
gods
encircled,
holds
his
reign.
Wide
o'er
the
deep,
which
line
could
ne'er
explore,
Shining
with
hoary
sand
of
silver
ore,
Extends
the
level,
where
the
palace
rears
Its
crystal
towers,
and
emulates
the
spheres;
So,
starry
bright,
the
lofty
turrets
blaze,
And,
vie
in
lustre
with
the
diamond's
rays.
Adorn'd
with
pillars,
and
with
roofs
of
gold,
The
golden
gates
their
massy
leaves
unfold:
Inwrought
with
pearl
the
lordly
pillars
shine,
The
sculptur'd
walls
confess
a
hand
divine.
Here,
various
colours
in
confusion
lost,
Old
Chaos'
face
and
troubled
image
boast.
Here,
rising
from
the
mass,
distinct
and
clear,
Apart,
the
four
fair
elements
appear.
High
o'er
the
rest
ascends
the
blaze
of
fire,
Nor,
fed
by
matter
did
the
rays
aspire,
But,
glow'd
ætherial,
as
the
living
flame,
Which,
stol'n
from
heav'n,
inspir'd
the
vital
frame.
Next,
all-embracing
air
was
spread
around,
Thin
as
the
light,
incapable
of
wound;
The
subtle
power
the
burning
south
pervades,
And
penetrates
the
depth
of
polar
shades.
Here,
mother
Earth,
with
mountains
crown'd,
is
seen,
Her
trees
in
blossom,
and
her
lawns
in
green;
The
lowing
beeves
adorn
the
clover
vales,
The
fleecy
dams
bespread
the
sloping
dales;
Here,
land
from
land
the
silver
streams
divide;
The
sportive
fishes
through
the
crystal
tide,
Bedropt
with
gold
their
shining
sides
display:
And
here,
old
Ocean
rolls
his
billows
gray:
Beneath
the
moon's
pale
orb
his
current
flows,
And,
round
the
earth,
his
giant
arms
he
throws.
Another
scene
display'd
the
dread
alarms
Of
war
in
heav'n,
and
mighty
Jove
in
arms;
Here,
Titan's
race
their
swelling
nerves
distend
Like
knotted
oaks,
and
from
their
bases
rend
And
tower
the
mountains
to
the
thund'ring
sky,
While
round
their
heads
the
forky
lightnings
fly;
Beneath
huge
Etna
vanquish'd
Typhon
lies,[403]
And
vomits
smoke
and
fire
against
the
darken'd
skies.
Here,
seems
the
pictur'd
wall
possess'd
of
life:
Two
gods
contending[404]
in
the
noble
strife,
The
choicest
boon
to
humankind
to
give,
Their
toils
to
lighten,
or
their
wants
relieve:
While
Pallas
here
appears
to
wave
her
hand,[405]
The
peaceful
olive's
silver
boughs
expand:
Here,
while
the
ocean's
god
indignant
frown'd,
And
rais'd
his
trident
from
the
wounded
ground,
As
yet
entangled
in
the
earth,
appears
The
warrior
horse;
his
ample
chest
he
rears,
His
wide
red
nostrils
smoke,
his
eye-balls
glare,
And
his
fore-hoofs,
high
pawing,
smite
the
air.
Though
wide,
and
various,
o'er
the
sculptur'd
stone[406]
The
feats
of
gods,
and
godlike
heroes
shone;
On
speed
the
vengeful
demon
views
no
more:
Forward
he
rushes
through
the
golden
door,
Where
ocean's
king,
enclos'd
with
nymphs
divine,
In
regal
state
receives
the
king
of
wine:[407]
"O
Neptune!"
instant
as
he
came,
he
cries,
"Here
let
my
presence
wake
no
cold
surprise.
A
friend
I
come,
your
friendship
to
implore
Against
the
Fates
unjust,
and
Fortune's
power;
Beneath
whose
shafts
the
great
Celestials
bow,
Yet
ere
I
more,
if
more
you
wish
to
know,
The
wat'ry
gods
in
awful
senate
call,
For
all
should
hear
the
wrong
that
touches
all."
Neptune
alarm'd,
with
instant
speed
commands
From
ev'ry
shore
to
call
the
wat'ry
bands:
Triton,
who
boasts
his
high
Neptunian
race,
Sprung
from
the
god
by
Salacé's[408]
embrace,
Attendant
on
his
sire
the
trumpet
sounds,
Or,
through
the
yielding
waves,
his
herald,
bounds:
Huge
is
his
bulk,
deform'd,
and
dark
his
hue;
His
bushy
beard,
and
hairs
that
never
knew
The
smoothing
comb,
of
seaweed
rank
and
long,
}
Around
his
breast
and
shoulders
dangling
hung,
}
And,
on
the
matted
locks
black
mussels
clung;
}
A
shell
of
purple
on
his
head
he
bore,[409]
Around
his
loins
no
tangling
garb
he
wore,
But
all
was
cover'd
with
the
slimy
brood,
The
snaily
offspring
of
the
unctuous
flood;
And
now,
obedient
to
his
dreadful
sire,
High
o'er
the
wave
his
brawny
arms
aspire;
To
his
black
mouth
his
crooked
shell
applied,
The
blast
rebellows
o'er
the
ocean
wide:
Wide
o'er
their
shores,
where'er
their
waters
flow,
The
wat'ry
powers
the
awful
summons
know;
And
instant,
darting
to
the
palace
hall,
Attend
the
founder
of
the
Dardan
wall;[410]
Old
Father
Ocean,
with
his
num'rous
race
Of
daughters
and
of
sons,
was
first
in
place.
Nereus
and
Doris,
from
whose
nuptials
sprung
The
lovely
Nereid
train,
for
ever
young,
Who
people
ev'ry
sea
on
ev'ry
strand,
Appear'd,
attended
with
their
filial
band;
And
changeful
Proteus,
whose
prophetic
mind[411]
The
secret
cause
of
Bacchus'
rage
divin'd,
Attending,
left
the
flocks,
his
scaly
charge,
To
graze
the
bitter,
weedy
foam
at
large.
In
charms
of
power
the
raging
waves
to
tame,
The
lovely
spouse
of
ocean's
sov'reign
came.[412]
From
Heaven
and
Vesta
sprung
the
birth
divine,
Her
snowy
limbs
bright
through
the
vestments
shine.
Here,
with
the
dolphin,
who
persuasive
led
Her
modest
steps
to
Neptune's
spousal
bed,
Fair
Amphitrité
mov'd,
more
sweet,
more
gay
Than
vernal
fragrance,
and
the
flowers
of
May;
Together
with
her
sister-spouse
she
came,
The
same
their
wedded
lord,
their
love
the
same;
The
same
the
brightness
of
their
sparkling
eyes,
Bright
as
the
sun,
and
azure
as
the
skies.
She,
who,
the
rage
of
Athamas
to
shun,[414]
Plung'd
in
the
billows
with
her
infant
son;
A
goddess
now,
a
god
the
smiling
boy,
Together
sped;
and
Glaucus
lost
to
joy,[415]
Curs'd
in
his
love
by
vengeful
Circé's
hate,
Attending,
wept
his
Scylla's
hapless
fate.
And
now,
assembled
in
the
hall
divine,
The
ocean
gods
in
solemn
council
join;
The
goddesses
on
pearl
embroid'ry
sat,
The
gods,
on
sparkling
crystal
chairs
of
state,
And,
proudly
honour'd,
on
the
regal
throne,
Beside
the
ocean's
lord,
Thyoneus[416]
shone.
High
from
the
roof
the
living
amber
glows,[417]
High
from
the
roof
the
stream
of
glory
flows,
And,
richer
fragrance
far
around
exhales
Than
that
which
breathes
on
fair
Arabia's
gales.
Attention
now,
in
list'ning
silence
waits:
The
power,
whose
bosom
rag'd
against
the
Fates,
Rising,
casts
round
his
vengeful
eyes,
while
rage
Spread
o'er
his
brows
the
wrinkled
seams
of
age.
"O
thou,"
he
cries,
"whose
birthright
sov'reign
sway,
From
pole
to
pole,
the
raging
waves
obey;
Of
human
race
'tis
thine
to
fix
the
bounds,
And
fence
the
nations
with
thy
wat'ry
mounds:
And
thou,
dread
power,
O
Father
Ocean,
hear,
Thou,
whose
wide
arms
embrace
the
world's
wide
sphere,
'Tis
thine
the
haughtiest
victor
to
restrain,
And
bind
each
nation
in
its
own
domain:
And
you,
ye
gods,
to
whom
the
seas
are
giv'n,
Your
just
partition
with
the
gods
of
heav'n;
You
who,
of
old
unpunish'd
never
bore
The
daring
trespass
of
a
foreign
oar;
You
who
beheld,
when
Earth's
dread
offspring
strove[418]
To
scale
the
vaulted
sky,
the
seat
of
Jove:
Indignant
Jove
deep
to
the
nether
world
The
rebel
band
in
blazing
thunders
hurl'd.
Alas!
the
great
monition
lost
on
you,
Supine
you
slumber,
while
a
roving
crew,
With
impious
search,
explore
the
wat'ry
way,
And,
unresisted,
through
your
empire
stray:
To
seize
the
sacred
treasures
of
the
main,
Their
fearless
prows
your
ancient
laws
disdain:
Where,
far
from
mortal
sight
his
hoary
head
Old
Ocean
hides,
their
daring
sails
they
spread,
And
their
glad
shouts
are
echo'd
where
the
roar
Of
mounting
billows
only
howl'd
before.
In
wonder,
silent,
ready
Boreas[419]
sees
Your
passive
languor,
and
neglectful
ease;
Ready,
with
force
auxiliar,
to
restrain
The
bold
intruders
on
your
awful
reign;
Prepar'd
to
burst
his
tempests,
as
of
old,
When
his
black
whirlwinds
o'er
the
ocean
roll'd,
And
rent
the
Mynian[420]
sails,
whose
impious
pride
First
brav'd
their
fury,
and
your
power
defied.
Nor
deem
that,
fraudful,
I
my
hope
deny;
My
darken'd
glory
sped
me
from
the
sky.
How
high
my
honours
on
the
Indian
shore!
How
soon
these
honours
must
avail
no
more!
Unless
these
rovers,
who
with
doubled
shame
To
stain
my
conquests,
bear
my
vassal's[421]
name,
Unless
they
perish
on
the
billowy
way.
Then
rouse,
ye
gods,
and
vindicate
your
sway.
The
powers
of
heaven,
in
vengeful
anguish,
see
The
tyrant
of
the
skies,
and
Fate's
decree;
The
dread
decree,
that
to
the
Lusian
train
Consigns,
betrays
your
empire
of
the
main:
Say,
shall
your
wrong
alarm
the
high
abodes?
Are
men
exalted
to
the
rank
of
gods?
O'er
you
exalted,
while
in
careless
ease
You
yield
the
wrested
trident
of
the
seas,
Usurp'd
your
monarchy,
your
honours
stain'd,
Your
birthright
ravish'd,
and
your
waves
profan'd!
Alike
the
daring
wrong
to
me,
to
you,
And,
shall
my
lips
in
vain
your
vengeance
sue!
This,
this
to
sue
from
high
Olympus
bore----"
More
he
attempts,
but
rage
permits
no
more.
Fierce,
bursting
wrath
the
wat'ry
gods
inspires,
And,
their
red
eye-balls
burn
with
livid
fires:
Heaving
and
panting
struggles
evr'y
breast,
With
the
fierce
billows
of
hot
ire
oppress'd.
Twice
from
his
seat
divining
Proteus
rose,
And
twice
he
shook,
enrag'd,
his
sedgy
brows:
In
vain;
the
mandate
was
already
giv'n,
From
Neptune
sent,
to
loose
the
winds
of
heav'n:
In
vain;
though
prophecy
his
lips
inspir'd,
The
ocean's
queen
his
silent
lips
requir'd.
Nor
less
the
storm
of
headlong
rage
denies,
Or
counsel
to
debate,
or
thought
to
rise.
And
now,
the
God
of
Tempests
swift
unbinds
From
their
dark
caves
the
various
rushing
winds:
High
o'er
the
storm
the
power
impetuous
rides,
His
howling
voice
the
roaring
tempest
guides;
Right
to
the
dauntless
fleet
their
rage
he
pours,
And,
first
their
headlong
outrage
tears
the
shores:
A
deeper
night
involves
the
darken'd
air,
And
livid
flashes
through
the
mountains
glare:
Uprooted
oaks,
with
all
their
leafy
pride,
Roll
thund'ring
down
the
groaning
mountain's
side;
And
men
and
herds
in
clam'rous
uproar
run,
The
rocking
towers
and
crashing
woods
to
shun.
While,
thus,
the
council
of
the
wat'ry
state
Enrag'd,
decreed
the
Lusian
heroes'
fate,
The
weary
fleet
before
the
gentle
gale
With
joyful
hope
display'd
the
steady
sail;
Thro'
the
smooth
deep
they
plough'd
the
length'ning
way;
Beneath
the
wave
the
purple
car
of
day
To
sable
night
the
eastern
sky
resign'd,
And,
o'er
the
decks
cold
breath'd
the
midnight
wind.
All
but
the
watch
in
warm
pavilions
slept,
The
second
watch
the
wonted
vigils
kept:
Supine
their
limbs,
the
mast
supports
the
head,
And
the
broad
yard-sail
o'er
their
shoulders
spread
A
grateful
cover
from
the
chilly
gale,
And
sleep's
soft
dews
their
heavy
eyes
assail.
Languid
against
the
languid
power
they
strive,
And,
sweet
discourse
preserves
their
thoughts
alive.
When
Leonardo,
whose
enamour'd
thought
In
every
dream
the
plighted
fair
one
sought--
"The
dews
of
sleep
what
better
to
remove
Than
the
soft,
woful,
pleasing
tales
of
love?"
"Ill-timed,
alas!"
the
brave
VELOSO
cries,
"The
tales
of
love,
that
melt
the
heart
and
eyes.
The
dear
enchantments
of
the
fair
I
know,
The
fearful
transport,
and
the
rapturous
woe:
But,
with
our
state
ill
suits
the
grief
or
joy;
Let
war,
let
gallant
war
our
thoughts
employ:
With
dangers
threaten'd,
let
the
tale
inspire
The
scorn
of
danger,
and
the
hero's
fire."
His
mates
with
joy
the
brave
VELOSO
hear,
And,
on
the
youth
the
speaker's
toil
confer.
The
brave
VELOSO
takes
the
word
with
joy,
"And
truth,"
he
cries,
"shall
these
slow
hours
decoy.
The
warlike
tale
adorns
our
nation's
fame,
The
twelve
of
England
give
the
noble
theme.
"When
Pedro's
gallant
heir,
the
valiant
John,
Gave
war's
full
splendour
to
the
Lusian
throne,
In
haughty
England,
where
the
winter
spreads
His
snowy
mantle
o'er
the
shining
meads,[422]
The
seeds
of
strife
the
fierce
Erynnis
sows;[423]
The
baleful
strife
from
court
dissension
rose.
With
ev'ry
charm
adorn'd,
and
ev'ry
grace,
That
spreads
its
magic
o'er
the
female
face,
Twelve
ladies
shin'd
the
courtly
train
among,
The
first,
the
fairest
of
the
courtly
throng;
But,
Envy's
breath
revil'd
their
injur'd
name,
And
stain'd
the
honour
of
their
virgin
fame.
Twelve
youthful
barons
own'd
the
foul
report,
The
charge
at
first,
perhaps,
a
tale
of
sport.
Ah,
base
the
sport
that
lightly
dares
defame
The
sacred
honour
of
a
lady's
name!
What
knighthood
asks
the
proud
accusers
yield,
And,
dare
the
damsels'
champions
to
the
field.[424]
'There
let
the
cause,
as
honour
wills,
be
tried,
And,
let
the
lance
and
ruthless
sword
decide.'
The
lovely
dames
implore
the
courtly
train,
With
tears
implore
them,
but
implore
in
vain.
So
fam'd,
so
dreaded
tower'd
each
boastful
knight,
The
damsels'
lovers
shunn'd
the
proffer'd
fight.
Of
arm
unable
to
repel
the
strong,
The
heart's
each
feeling
conscious
of
the
wrong,
When,
robb'd
of
all
the
female
breast
holds
dear,
Ah
Heaven,
how
bitter
flows
the
female
tear!
To
Lancaster's
bold
duke
the
damsels
sue;
Adown
their
cheeks,
now
paler
than
the
hue
Of
snowdrops
trembling
to
the
chilly
gale,
The
slow-pac'd
crystal
tears
their
wrongs
bewail.
When
down
the
beauteous
face
the
dew-drop
flows,
What
manly
bosom
can
its
force
oppose!
His
hoary
curls
th'
indignant
hero
shakes,
And,
all
his
youthful
rage
restor'd,
awakes:
'Though
loth,'
he
cries,
'to
plunge
my
bold
compeers
In
civil
discord,
yet,
appease
your
tears:
From
Lusitania'--for,
on
Lusian
ground
Brave
Lancaster
had

crown'd;
Had
mark'd
how

shone,
What

How
matchless

the

When,
thund'ring
at

they
rul'd
the

Nor

their
ardent

for
the
fair,
Gen'rous
and
brave,
he
view'd
with
wond'ring

When,
crown'd
with

to
the

The
warlike

led--
'From
Lusitania's
clime,'
the
hero
cries,
'The
gallant
champions
of
your
fame
shall
rise.
Their
hearts
will
burn
(for
well
their
hearts
I
know)
To
pour
your
vengeance
on
the
guilty
foe.
Let
courtly
phrase
the
heroes'
worth
admire,
And,
for
your
injur'd
names,
that
worth
require:
Let
all
the
soft
endearments
of
the
fair,
And
words
that
weep
your
wrongs,
your
wrongs
declare.
Myself
the
heralds
to
the
chiefs
will
send,
And
to
the
king,
my
valiant
son,
commend.'
He
spoke;
and
twelve
of
Lusian
race
he
names
All
noble
youths,
the
champions
of
the
dames.
The
dames,
by
lot,
their
gallant
champions
choose,[426]
And
each
her
hero's
name,
exulting,
views.
Each
in
a
various
letter
hails
her
chief,
And,
earnest
for
his
aid,
relates
her
grief:
Each
to
the
king
her
courtly
homage
sends,
And
valiant
Lancaster
their
cause
commends.
Soon
as
to
Tagus'
shores
the
heralds
came,
Swift
through
the
palace
pours
the
sprightly
flame
Of
high-soul'd
chivalry;
the
monarch
glows
First
on
the
listed
field
to
dare
the
foes;
But
regal
state
withheld.
Alike
their
fires,
Each
courtly
noble
to
the
toil
aspires:
High
on
his
helm,
the
envy
of
his
peers,
Each
chosen
knight
the
plume
of
combat
wears.
In
that
proud
port,
half
circled
by
the
wave,
Which
Portugallia
to
the
nation
gave,
A
deathless
name,[427]
a
speedy
sloop
receives
The
sculptur'd
bucklers,
and
the
clasping
greaves,
The
swords
of
Ebro,
spears
of
lofty
size,
And
breast-plates,
flaming
with
a
thousand
dyes,
Helmets
high
plum'd,
and,
pawing
for
the
fight,
Bold
steeds,
whose
harness
shone
with
silv'ry
light
Dazzling
the
day.
And
now,
the
rising
gale
Invites
the
heroes,
and
demands
the
sail,
When
brave
Magricio
thus
his
peers
address'd,
'Oh,
friends
in
arms,
of
equal
powers
confess'd,
Long
have
I
hop'd
through
foreign
climes
to
stray,
Where
other
streams
than
Douro
wind
their
way;
To
note
what
various
shares
of
bliss
and
woe
From
various
laws
and
various
customs
flow;
Nor
deem
that,
artful,
I
the
fight
decline;
England
shall
know
the
combat
shall
be
mine.
By
land
I
speed,
and,
should
dark
fate
prevent,
(For
death
alone
shall
blight
my
firm
intent),
Small
may
the
sorrow
for
my
absence
be,
For
yours
were
conquest,
though
unshar'd
by
me.
Yet,
something
more
than
human
warms
my
breast,
And
sudden
whispers,[428]
In
our
fortunes
blest,
Nor
envious
chance,
nor
rocks,
nor
whelmy
tide,
Shall
our
glad
meeting
at
the
list
divide.'
"He
said;
and
now,
the
rites
of
parting
friends
Sufficed,
through
Leon
and
Castile
he
bends.
On
many
a
field,
enrapt,
the
hero
stood,
And
the
proud
scenes
of
Lusian
conquest
view'd.
Navarre
he
pass'd,
and
pass'd
the
dreary
wild,
Where
rocks
on
rocks
o'er
yawning
glens
are
pil'd;
The
wolf's
dread
range,
where,
to
the
ev'ning
skies
In
clouds
involv'd,
the
cold
Pyrenians
rise.
Through
Gallia's
flow'ry
vales,
and
wheaten
plains
He
strays,
and
Belgia
now
his
steps
detains.
There,
as
forgetful
of
his
vow'd
intent,
In
various
cares
the
fleeting
days
he
spent:
His
peers,
the
while,
direct
to
England's
strand,
Plough
the
chill
northern
wave;
and
now,
at
land,
Adorn'd
in
armour,
and
embroid'ry
gay,
To
lordly
London
hold
the
crowded
way:
Bold
Lancaster
receives
the
knights
with
joy;
The
feast,
and
warlike
song
each
hour
employ.
The
beauteous
dames,
attending,
wake
their
fire,
With
tears
enrage
them,
and
with
smiles
inspire.
And
now,
with
doubtful
blushes
rose
the
day,
Decreed
the
rites
of
wounded
fame
to
pay.
The
English
monarch
gives
the
listed
bounds,
And,
fix'd
in
rank,
with
shining
spears
surrounds.
Before
their
dames
the
gallant
knights
advance,
(Each
like
a
Mars),
and
shake
the
beamy
lance:
The
dames,
adorn'd
in
silk
and
gold,
display
A
thousand
colours
glitt'ring
to
the
day:
Alone
in
tears,
and
doleful
mourning,
came,
Unhonour'd
by
her
knight,
Magricio's
dame.
'Fear
not
our
prowess,'
cry
the
bold
eleven,
'In
numbers,
not
in
might,
we
stand
uneven.
More
could
we
spare,
secure
of
dauntless
might,
When
for
the
injur'd
female
name
we
fight.'
"Beneath
a
canopy
of
regal
state,
High
on
a
throne,
the
English
monarch
sat,
All
round,
the
ladies
and
the
barons
bold,
Shining
in
proud
array,
their
stations
hold.
Now,
o'er
the
theatre
the
champions
pour,
And
facing
three
to
three,
and
four
to
four,
Flourish
their
arms
in
prelude.
From
the
bay
Where
flows
the
Tagus
to
the
Indian
sea,
The
sun
beholds
not,
in
his
annual
race,
A
twelve
more
sightly,
more
of
manly
grace
Than
tower'd
the
English
knights.
With
frothing
jaws,
Furious,
each
steed
the
bit
restrictive
gnaws,
And,
rearing
to
approach
the
rearing
foe,
Their
wavy
manes
are
dash'd
with
foamy
snow:
Cross-darting
to
the
sun
a
thousand
rays,
The
champions'
helmets
as
the
crystal
blaze.
Ah
now,
the
trembling
ladies'
cheeks
how
wan!
Cold
crept
their
blood;
when,
through
the
tumult
ran
A
shout,
loud
gath'ring;
turn'd
was
ev'ry
eye
Where
rose
the
shout,
the
sudden
cause
to
spy.
And
lo,
in
shining
arms
a
warrior
rode,
With
conscious
pride
his
snorting
courser
trod;
Low
to
the
monarch,
and
the
dames
he
bends,
And
now,
the
great
Magricio
joins
his
friends.
With
looks
that
glow'd,
exulting
rose
the
fair,
Whose
wounded
honour
claim'd
the
hero's
care.
Aside
the
doleful
weeds
of
mourning
thrown,
In
dazzling
purple,
and
in
gold
she
shone.
Now,
loud
the
signal
of
the
fight
rebounds,
Quiv'ring
the
air,
the
meeting
shock
resounds
Hoarse,
crashing
uproar;
griding
splinters
spring
Far
round,
and
bucklers
dash'd
on
bucklers
ring.
Their
swords
flash
lightning;
darkly
reeking
o'er
The
shining
mail-plates
flows
the
purple
gore.
Torn
by
the
spur,
the
loosen'd
reins
at
large,
Furious,
the
steeds
in
thund'ring
plunges
charge;
Trembles
beneath
their
hoofs
the
solid
ground,
And,
thick
the
fiery
sparkles
flash
around,
A
dreadful
blaze!
With
pleasing
horror
thrill'd,
The
crowd
behold
the
terrors
of
the
field.
Here,
stunn'd
and
stagg'ring
with
the
forceful
blow,
A
bending
champion
grasps
the
saddle-bow;
Here,
backward
bent,
a
falling
knight
reclines,
His
plumes,
dishonour'd,
lash
the
courser's
loins.
So,
tir'd
and
stagger'd
toil'd
the
doubtful
fight,
When
great
Magricio,
kindling
all
his
might,
Gave
all
his
rage
to
burn:
with
headlong
force,
Conscious
of
victory,
his
bounding
horse
Wheels
round
and
round
the
foe;
the
hero's
spear
Now
on
the
front,
now
flaming
on
the
rear,
Mows
down
their
firmest
battle;
groans
the
ground
}
Beneath
his
courser's
smiting
hoofs:
far
round
}
The
cloven
helms
and
splinter'd
shields
resound.
}
Here,
torn
and
trail'd
in
dust
the
harness
gay,
From
the
fall'n
master
springs
the
steed
away;
Obscene
with
dust
and
gore,
slow
from
the
ground
Rising,
the
master
rolls
his
eyes
around,
Pale
as
a
spectre
on
the
Stygian
coast,
In
all
the
rage
of
shame
confus'd,
and
lost:
Here,
low
on
earth,
and
o'er
the
riders
thrown,
The
wallowing
coursers
and
the
riders
groan:
Before
their
glimm'ring
vision
dies
the
light,
And,
deep
descends
the
gloom
of
death's
eternal
night.
They
now
who
boasted,
'Let
the
sword
decide,'
Alone
in
flight's
ignoble
aid
confide:
Loud
to
the
skies
the
shout
of
joy
proclaims
The
spotless
honour
of
the
ladies'
names.
"In
painted
halls
of
state,
and
rosy
bowers,
The
twelve
brave
Lusians
crown
the
festive
hours.
Bold
Lancaster
the
princely
feast
bestows,
The
goblet
circles,
and
the
music
flows;
And
ev'ry
care,
the
transport
of
their
joy,
To
tend
the
knights
the
lovely
dames
employ;
The
green-bough'd
forests
by
the
lawns
of
Thames
Behold
the
victor-champions,
and
the
dames
Rouse
the
tall
roe-buck
o'er
the
dews
of
morn,
While,
through
the
dales
of
Kent
resounds
the
bugle-horn.
The
sultry
noon
the
princely
banquet
owns,
The
minstrel's
song
of
war
the
banquet
crowns:
And,
when
the
shades
of
gentle
ev'ning
fall,
Loud
with
the
dance
resounds
the
lordly
hall:
The
golden
roofs,
while
Vesper
shines,
prolong
The
trembling
echoes
of
the
harp
and
song.
Thus
pass'd
the
days
on
England's
happy
strand,
Till
the
dear
mem'ry
of
their
natal
land
Sigh'd
for
the
banks
of
Tagus.
Yet,
the
breast
Of
brave
Magricio
spurns
the
thoughts
of
rest.
In
Gaul's
proud
court
he
sought
the
listed
plain,
In
arms,
an
injur'd
lady's
knight
again.
As
Rome's
Corvinus[429]
o'er
the
field
he
strode,
And,
on
the
foe's
huge
cuirass
proudly
trod.
No
more
by
tyranny's
proud
tongue
revil'd,
The
Flandrian
countess
on
her
hero
smil'd.[430]
The
Rhine
another
pass'd,
and
prov'd
his
might,[431]
A
fraudful
German
dar'd
him
to
the
fight.
Strain'd
in
his
grasp,
the
fraudful
boaster
fell----"
Here
sudden
stopp'd
the
youth;
the
distant
yell
Of
gath'ring
tempest
sounded
in
his
ears,
Unheard,
unheeded
by
his
list'ning
peers.
Earnest,
at
full,
they
urge
him
to
relate
Magricio's
combat,
and
the
German's
fate.
When,
shrilly
whistling
through
the
decks,
resounds
The
master's
call,
and
loud
his
voice
rebounds:
Instant
from
converse,
and
from
slumber,
start
Both
bands,
and
instant
to
their
toils
they
dart.
"Aloft,
oh
speed,
down,
down
the
topsails!"
cries
The
master:
"sudden
from
my
earnest
eyes
Vanish'd
the
stars;
slow
rolls
the
hollow
sigh,
The
storm's
dread
herald."
To
the
topsails
fly
The
bounding
youths,
and
o'er
the
yardarms
whirl
The
whizzing
ropes,
and
swift
the
canvas
furl;
When,
from
their
grasp
the
bursting
tempests
bore
The
sheets
half-gather'd,
and
in
fragments
tore.
"Strike,
strike
the
mainsail!"
loud
again
he
rears
His
echoing
voice;
when,
roaring
in
their
ears,
As
if
the
starry
vault,
by
thunders
riv'n,
Rush'd
downward
to
the
deep
the
walls
of
heav'n,
With
headlong
weight
a
fiercer
blast
descends,
And,
with
sharp
whirring
crash,
the
mainsail
rends;
Loud
shrieks
of
horror
through
the
fleet
resound;
Bursts
the
torn
cordage;
rattle
far
around
The
splinter'd
yardarms;
from
each
bending
mast,
In
many
a
shred,
far
streaming
on
the
blast
The
canvas
floats;
low
sinks
the
leeward
side,
O'er
the
broad
vessels
rolls
the
swelling
tide:
"Oh
strain
each
nerve!"
the
frantic
pilot
cries--
"Oh
now!"--and
instant
every
nerve
applies,
Tugging
what
cumbrous
lay,
with
strainful
force;
Dash'd
by
the
pond'rous
loads,
the
surges
hoarse
Roar
in
new
whirls:
the
dauntless
soldiers
ran
To
pump,
yet,
ere
the
groaning
pump
began
The
wave
to
vomit,
o'er
the
decks
o'erthrown
In
grovelling
heaps,
the
stagger'd
soldiers
groan:
So
rolls
the
vessel,
not
the
boldest
three,
Of
arm
robustest,
and
of
firmest
knee,
Can
guide
the
starting
rudder;
from
their
hands
The
helm
bursts;
scarce
a
cable's
strength
commands
The
stagg'ring
fury
of
its
starting
bounds,
While
to
the
forceful,
beating
surge
resounds
The
hollow
crazing
hulk:
with
kindling
rage
The
adverse
winds
the
adverse
winds
engage,
As,
from
its
base
of
rock
their
banded
power
Strove
in
the
dust
to
strew
some
lordly
tower,
Whose
dented
battlements
in
middle
sky
Frown
on
the
tempest
and
its
rage
defy;
So,
roar'd
the
winds:
high
o'er
the
rest
upborne
On
the
wide
mountain-wave's
slant
ridge
forlorn,
At
times
discover'd
by
the
lightnings
blue,
Hangs
GAMA'S
lofty
vessel,
to
the
view
Small
as
her
boat;
o'er
Paulus'
shatter'd
prore
Falls
the
tall
mainmast,
prone,
with
crashing
roar;
Their
hands,
yet
grasping
their
uprooted
hair,
The
sailors
lift
to
heaven
in
wild
despair,
The
Saviour-God
each
yelling
voice
implores.
Nor
less
from
brave
Coello's
war-ship
pours
The
shriek,
shrill
rolling
on
the
tempest's
wings:
Dire
as
the
bird
of
death
at
midnight
sings
His
dreary
howlings
in
the
sick
man's
ear,
The
answ'ring
shriek
from
ship
to
ship
they
hear.
Now,
on
the
mountain-billows
upward
driv'n,
The
navy
mingles
with
the
clouds
of
heav'n;
Now,
rushing
downward
with
the
sinking
waves,
Bare
they
behold
old
Ocean's
vaulty
caves.
The
eastern
blast
against
the
western
pours,
Against
the
southern
storm
the
northern
roars:
From
pole
to
pole
the
flashy
lightnings
glare,
One
pale,
blue,
twinkling
sheet
enwraps
the
air;
In
swift
succession
now
the
volleys
fly,
Darted
in
pointed
curvings
o'er
the
sky;
And,
through
the
horrors
of
the
dreadful
night,
O'er
the
torn
waves
they
shed
a
ghastly
light;
The
breaking
surges
flame
with
burning
red,
Wider,
and
louder
still
the
thunders
spread,
As
if
the
solid
heav'ns
together
crush'd,
Expiring
worlds
on
worlds
expiring
rush'd,
And
dim-brow'd
Chaos
struggled
to
regain
The
wild
confusion
of
his
ancient
reign.
Not
such
the
volley
when
the
arm
of
Jove
From
heav'n's
high
gates
the
rebel
Titans
drove;
Not
such
fierce
lightnings
blaz'd
athwart
the
flood,
When,
sav'd
by
Heaven,
Deucalion's
vessel
rode
High
o'er
the
delug'd
hills.
Along
the
shore
The
halcyons,
mindful
of
their
fate,
deplore;[432]
As
beating
round,
on
trembling
wings
they
fly,
Shrill
through
the
storm
their
woful
clamours
die.
So,
from
the
tomb,
when
midnight
veils
the
plains,
With
shrill,
faint
voice,
th'
untimely
ghost
complains.[433]
The
am'rous
dolphins
to
their
deepest
caves
In
vain
retreat,
to
fly
the
furious
waves;
High
o'er
the
mountain-capes
the
ocean
flows,
And
tears
the
aged
forests
from
their
brows:
The
pine
and
oak's
huge,
sinewy
roots
uptorn,
And,
from
their
beds
the
dusky
sands
upborne
On
the
rude
whirlings
of
the
billowy
sweep,
Imbrown
the
surface
of
the
boiling
deep.
High
to
the
poop
the
valiant
GAMA
springs,
And
all
the
rage
of
grief
his
bosom
wrings,
Grief
to
behold,
the
while
fond
hope
enjoy'd
The
meed
of
all
his
toils,
that
hope
destroy'd.
In
awful
horror
lost,
the
hero
stands,
And
rolls
his
eyes
to
heav'n,
and
spreads
his
hands,
While
to
the
clouds
his
vessel
rides
the
swell,
And
now,
her
black
keel
strikes
the
gates
of
hell;
"O
Thou,"
he
cries,
"whom
trembling
heav'n
obeys,
Whose
will
the
tempest's
furious
madness
sways,
Who,
through
the
wild
waves,
ledd'st
Thy
chosen
race,
While
the
high
billows
stood
like
walls
of
brass:[434]
O
Thou,
while
ocean
bursting
o'er
the
world
Roar'd
o'er
the
hills,
and
from
the
sky
down
hurl'd
Rush'd
other
headlong
oceans;
oh,
as
then
The
second
father
of
the
race
of
men[435]
Safe
in
Thy
care
the
dreadful
billows
rode,
Oh!
save
us
now,
be
now
the
Saviour-God!
Safe
in
Thy
care,
what
dangers
have
we
pass'd!
And
shalt
Thou
leave
us,
leave
us
now
at
last
To
perish
here--our
dangers

our

To
spread
Thy

Thy
smiles;
Our
vows
unheard?
Heavy
with
all
thy
weight,
Oh
horror,
come!
and
come,
eternal
night!"
He
paus'd;--then
round
his
eyes
and
arms
he
threw
In
gesture
wild,
and
thus:
"Oh
happy
you!
You,
who
in
Afric
fought
for
holy
faith,
And,
pierc'd
with
Moorish
spears,
in
glorious
death
Beheld
the
smiling
heav'ns
your
toils
reward,
By
your
brave
mates
beheld
the
conquest
shar'd;
Oh
happy
you,
on
every
shore
renown'd!
Your
vows
respected,
and
your
wishes
crown'd."
He
spoke;
redoubled
rag'd
the
mingled
blasts;
Through
the
torn
cordage
and
the
shatter'd
masts
The
winds
loud
whistled,
fiercer
lightnings
blaz'd,
And
louder
roars
the
doubled
thunders
rais'd,
The
sky
and
ocean
blending,
each
on
fire,
Seem'd
as
all
Nature
struggled
to
expire.
When
now,
the
silver
star
of
Love
appear'd,[436]
Bright
in
the
east
her
radiant
front
she
rear'd;
Fair,
through
the
horrid
storm,
the
gentle
ray
Announc'd
the
promise
of
the
cheerful
day;
From
her
bright
throne
Celestial
Love
beheld
The
tempest
burn,
and
blast
on
blast
impell'd:
"And
must
the
furious
demon
still,"
she
cries,
"Still
urge
his
rage,
nor
all
the
past
suffice!
Yet,
as
the
past,
shall
all
his
rage
be
vain----"
She
spoke,
and
darted
to
the
roaring
main;
Her
lovely
nymphs
she
calls,
the
nymphs
obey,
Her
nymphs
the
virtues
who
confess
her
sway;
Round
ev'ry
brow
she
bids
the
rose-buds
twine,
And
ev'ry
flower
adown
the
locks
to
shine,
The
snow-white
lily,
and
the
laurel
green,
And
pink
and
yellow
as
at
strife
be
seen.
Instant,
amid
their
golden
ringlets
strove
Each
flow'ret,
planted
by
the
hand
of
Love;
At
strife,
who
first
th'
enamour'd
powers
to
gain,
Who
rule
the
tempests
and
the
waves
restrain:
Bright
as
a
starry
band
the
Nereids
shone,
Instant
old
Eolus'
sons
their
presence[437]
own;
The
winds
die
faintly,
and,
in
softest
sighs,
Each
at
his
fair
one's
feet
desponding
lies:
The
bright
Orithia,
threatening,
sternly
chides
The
furious
Boreas,
and
his
faith
derides;
The
furious
Boreas
owns
her
powerful
bands:
Fair
Galatea,
with
a
smile
commands
The
raging
Notus,
for
his
love,
how
true,
His
fervent
passion
and
his
faith
she
knew.
Thus,
every
nymph
her
various
lover
chides;
The
silent
winds
are
fetter'd
by
their
brides;
And,
to
the
goddess
of
celestial
loves,
Mild
as
her
look,
and
gentle
as
her
doves,
In
flow'ry
bands
are
brought.
Their
am'rous
flame
The
queen
approves,
and
"ever
burn
the
same,"
She
cries,
and
joyful
on
the
nymphs'
fair
hands,
Th'
Eolian
race
receive
the
queen's
commands,
And
vow,
that
henceforth
her
Armada's
sails
Should
gently
swell
with
fair
propitious
gales.[438]
Now,
morn,
serene,
in
dappled
grey
arose
O'er
the
fair
lawns
where
murm'ring
Ganges
flows;
Pale
shone
the
wave
beneath
the
golden
beam,
Blue,
o'er
the
silver
flood,
Malabria's
mountains
gleam;
The
sailors
on
the
main-top's
airy
round,
"Land,
land!"
aloud
with
waving
hands
resound;
Aloud
the
pilot
of
Melinda
cries,
"Behold,
O
chief,
the
shores
of
India
rise!"
Elate,
the
joyful
crew
on
tip-toe
trod,
And
every
breast
with
swelling
raptures
glow'd;
GAMA's
great
soul
confess'd
the
rushing
swell,
Prone
on
his
manly
knees
the
hero
fell;
"O
bounteous
heav'n!"
he
cries,
and
spreads
his
hands
To
bounteous
heav'n,
while
boundless
joy
commands
No
further
word
to
flow.
In
wonder
lost,
As
one
in
horrid
dreams
through
whirlpools
toss'd,
Now,
snatch'd
by
demons,
rides
the
flaming
air,
And
howls,
and
hears
the
howlings
of
despair;
Awak'd,
amaz'd,
confus'd
with
transport
glows,
And,
trembling
still,
with
troubled
joy
o'erflows;
So,
yet
affected
with
the
sickly
weight
Left
by
the
horrors
of
the
dreadful
night,
The
hero
wakes,
in
raptures
to
behold
The
Indian
shores
before
his
prows
unfold:
Bounding,
he
rises,
and,
with
eyes
on
fire,
Surveys
the
limits
of
his
proud
desire.
O
glorious
chief,
while
storms
and
oceans
rav'd,
What
hopeless
toils
thy
dauntless
valour
brav'd!
By
toils
like
thine
the
brave
ascend
to
heav'n,
By
toils
like
thine
immortal
fame
is
giv'n.
Not
he,
who
daily
moves
in
ermine
gown,
Who
nightly
slumbers
on
the
couch
of
down;
Who
proudly
boasts
through
heroes
old
to
trace
The
lordly
lineage
of
his
titled
race;
Proud
of
the
smiles
of
every
courtier
lord,
A
welcome
guest
at
every
courtier's
board;
Not
he,
the
feeble
son
of
ease,
may
claim
Thy
wreath,
O
GAMA,
or
may
hope
thy
fame.
'Tis
he,
who
nurtur'd
on
the
tented
field,
From
whose
brown
cheek
each
tint
of
fear
expell'd,
With
manly
face
unmov'd,
secure,
serene,
Amidst
the
thunders
of
the
deathful
scene,
From
horror's
mouth
dares
snatch
the
warrior's
crown,
His
own
his
honours,
all
his
fame
his
own:
Who,
proudly
just
to
honour's
stern
commands,
The
dogstar's
rage
on
Afric's
burning
sands,
Or
the
keen
air
of
midnight
polar
skies,
Long
watchful
by
the
helm,
alike
defies:
Who,
on
his
front,
the
trophies
of
the
wars,
Bears
his
proud
knighthood's
badge,
his
honest
scars;
Who,
cloth'd
in
steel,
by
thirst,
by
famine
worn,
Through
raging
seas
by
bold
ambition
borne,
Scornful
of
gold,
by
noblest
ardour
fir'd,
Each
wish
by
mental
dignity
inspir'd,
Prepar'd
each
ill
to
suffer,
or
to
dare,
To
bless
mankind,
his
great,
his
only
care;
Him
whom
her
son
mature
Experience
owns,
Him,
him
alone
Heroic
Glory
crowns.
Once
more
the
translator
is
tempted
to
confess
his
opinion,
that
the
contrary
practice
of
Homer
and
Virgil
affords,
in
reality,
no
reasonable
objection
against
the
exclamatory
exuberances
of
Camoëns.
Homer,
though
the
father
of
the
epic
poem,
has
his
exuberances,
which
violently
trespass
against
the
first
rule
of
the
epopea,
the
unity
of
the
action.
A
rule
which,
strictly
speaking,
is
not
outraged
by
the
digressive
exclamations
of
Camoëns.
The
one
now
before
us,
as
the
severest
critic
must
allow,
is
happily
adapted
to
the
subject
of
the
book.
The
great
dangers
which
the
hero
had
hitherto
encountered
are
particularly
described.
He
is
afterwards
brought
in
safety
to
the
Indian
shore,
the
object
of
his
ambition,
and
of
all
his
toils.
The
exclamation,
therefore,
on
the
grand
hinge
of
the
poem
has
its
propriety,
and
discovers
the
warmth
of
its
author's
genius.
It
must
also
please,
as
it
is
strongly
characteristic
of
the
temper
of
our
military
poet.
The
manly
contempt
with
which
he
speaks
of
the
luxurious,
inactive
courtier,
and
the
delight
and
honour
with
which
he
talks
of
the
toils
of
the
soldier,
present
his
own
active
life
to
the
reader
of
sensibility.
His
campaigns
in
Africa,
where
in
a
gallant
attack
he
lost
an
eye,
his
dangerous
life
at
sea,
and
the
military
fatigues,
and
the
battles
in
which
he
bore
an
honourable
share
in
India,
rise
to
our
idea,
and
possess
us
with
an
esteem
and
admiration
of
our
martial
poet,
who
thus
could
look
back
with
a
gallant
enthusiasm
(though
his
modesty
does
not
mention
himself)
on
all
the
hardships
he
had
endured;
who
thus
could
bravely
esteem
the
dangers
to
which
he
had
been
exposed,
and
by
which
he
had
severely
suffered,
as
the
most
desirable
occurrences
of
his
life,
and
the
ornament
of
his
name.

OF
THE
SIXTH
BOOK.
BOOK
VII.
THE
ARGUMENT.
The
poet,
having
expatiated
on
the
glorious
achievements
of
the
Portuguese,
describes
the
Germans,
English,
French,
and
Italians,
reproaching
them
for
their
profane
wars
and
luxury,
while
they
ought
to
have
been
employed
in
opposing
the
enemies
of
the
Christian
faith.
He
then
describes
the
western
peninsula
of
India--the
shores
of
Malabar--and
Calicut,
the
capital
of
the
Zamorim,
where
Gama
had
landed.
Monsaide,
a
Moor
of
Barbary,
is
met
with,
who
addresses
Gama
in
Spanish,
and
offers
to
serve
him
as
interpreter,
Monsaide
gives
him
a
particular
account
of
everything
in
India.
The
Zamorim
invites
Gama
to
an
audience.
The
catual,
or
prime
minister,
with
his
officers,
visits
the
ships,
and
embraces
the
opportunity
of
asking
Gama
to
relate
to
him
the
history
of
Portugal.
Hail
glorious
chief![439]
where
never
chief
before
Forc'd
his
bold
way,
all
hail
on
India's
shore!
And
hail,
Ye
Lusian
heroes,
fair
and
wide
What
groves
of
palm,
to
haughty
Rome
denied,
For
you
by
Ganges'
length'ning
banks
unfold!
What
laurel-forests
on
the
shores
of
gold
For
you
their
honours
ever
verdant
rear,
Proud,
with
their
leaves,
to
twine
the
Lusian
spear!
Ah
Heav'n!
what
fury
Europe's
sons
controls!
What
self-consuming
discord
fires
their
souls!
'Gainst
her
own
breast
her
sword
Germania
turns,
Through
all
her
states
fraternal
rancour
burns;[440]
Some,
blindly
wand'ring,
holy
faith
disclaim,[441]
And,
fierce
through
all,
wild
rages
civil
flame.
High
sound
the
titles
of
the
English
crown,
"King
of
Jerusalem,"[442]
his
old
renown!
Alas,
delighted
with
an
airy
name,
The
thin,
dim
shadow
of
departed
fame,
England's
stern
monarch,
sunk
in
soft
repose,
Luxurious
riots
mid
his
northern
snows:
Or,
if
the
starting
burst
of
rage
succeed,
His
brethren
are
his
foes,
and
Christians
bleed;
While
Hagar's
brutal
race
his
titles
stain,
}
In
weeping
Salem
unmolested
reign,
}
And
with
their
rites
impure
her
holy
shrines
profane.
}
And
thou,
O
Gaul,[443]
with
gaudy
trophies
plum'd.
"Most
Christian"
nam'd;
alas,
in
vain
assum'd!
What
impious
lust
of
empire
steels
thy
breast[444]
From
their
just
lords
the
Christian
lands
to
wrest!
While
holy
faith's
hereditary
foes[445]
Possess
the
treasures
where
Cynifio
flows;[446]
And
all
secure,
behold
their
harvests
smile
In
waving
gold
along
the
banks
of
Nile.
And
thou,
O
lost
to
glory,
lost
to
fame,
Thou
dark
oblivion
of
thy
ancient
name,
By
every
vicious
luxury
debas'd,
Each
noble
passion
from
thy
breast
eras'd,
Nerveless
in
sloth,
enfeebling
arts
thy
boast,
O
Italy,
how
fall'n,
how
low,
how
lost![447]
In
vain,
to
thee,
the
call
of
glory
sounds,
Thy
sword
alone
thy
own
soft
bosom
wounds.
Ah,
Europe's
sons,
ye
brother-powers,
in
you
The
fables
old
of
Cadmus[448]
now
are
true;
Fierce
rose
the
brothers
from
the
dragon
teeth,
And
each
fell,
crimson'd
with
a
brother's
death.
So,
fall
the
bravest
of
the
Christian
name,[449]
While
dogs
unclean[450]
Messiah's
lore
blaspheme,
And
howl
their
curses
o'er
the
holy
tomb,
While
to
the
sword
the
Christian
race
they
doom.
From
age
to
age,
from
shore
to
distant
shore,
By
various
princes
led,
their
legions
pour;
United
all
in
one
determin'd
aim,
From
ev'ry
land
to
blot
the
Christian
name.
Then
wake,
ye
brother-powers,
combin'd
awake,
And,
from
the
foe
the
great
example
take.
If
empire
tempt
ye,
lo,
the
East
expands,
Fair
and
immense,
her
summer-garden
lands:
There,
boastful
Wealth
displays
her
radiant
store;
Pactol
and
Hermus'
streams,
o'er
golden
ore,
Roll
their
long
way;
but,
not
for
you
they
flow,
Their
treasures
blaze
on
the
stern
sultan's
brow:
For
him
Assyria
plies
the
loom
of
gold,
And
Afric's
sons
their
deepest
mines
unfold
To
build
his
haughty
throne.
Ye
western
powers,
To
throw
the
mimic
bolt
of
Jove
is
yours,
Yours
all
the
art
to
wield
the
arms
of
fire,
Then,
bid
the
thunders
of
the
dreadful
tire
Against
the
walls
of
dread
Byzantium[451]
roar,
Till,
headlong
driven
from
Europe's
ravish'd
shore
To
their
cold
Scythian
wilds,
and
dreary
dens,
By
Caspian
mountains,
and
uncultur'd
fens,
(Their
fathers'
seats
beyond
the
Wolgian
Lake,[452])
The
barb'rous
race
of
Saracen
betake.
And
hark,
to
you
the
woful
Greek
exclaims;
The
Georgian
fathers
and
th'
Armenian
dames,
Their
fairest
offspring
from
their
bosoms
torn,
(A
dreadful
tribute!)[453]
loud
imploring
mourn.
Alas,
in
vain!
their
offspring
captive
led,
In
Hagar's[454]
sons'
unhallow'd
temples
bred,
To
rapine
train'd,
arise
a
brutal
host,
The
Christian
terror,
and
the
Turkish
boast.
Yet
sleep,
ye
powers
of
Europe,
careless
sleep,
To
you
in
vain
your
eastern
brethren
weep;
Yet,
not
in
vain
their
woe-wrung
tears
shall
sue,
Though
small
the
Lusian
realms,
her
legions
few,
The
guardian
oft
by
Heav'n
ordain'd
before,
The
Lusian
race
shall
guard
Messiah's
lore.
When
Heav'n
decreed
to
crush
the
Moorish
foe
Heav'n
gave
the
Lusian
spear
to
strike
the
blow.
When
Heav'n's
own
laws
o'er
Afric's
shores
were
heard,
The
sacred
shrines
the
Lusian
heroes
rear'd;[455]
Nor
shall
their
zeal
in
Asia's
bounds
expire,
Asia,
subdu'd,
shall
fume
with
hallow'd
fire.
When
the
red
sun
the
Lusian
shore
forsakes,
And
on
the
lap
of
deepest
west[456]
awakes,
O'er
the
wild
plains,
beneath
unincens'd
skies
The
sun
shall
view
the
Lusian
altars
rise.
And,
could
new
worlds
by
human
step
be
trod,
Those
worlds
should
tremble
at
the
Lusian
nod.[457]
And
now,
their
ensigns
blazing
o'er
the
tide,
On
India's
shore
the
Lusian
heroes
ride.
High
to
the
fleecy
clouds
resplendent
far
Appear
the
regal
towers
of
Malabar,
Imperial
Calicut,[458]
the
lordly
seat
Of
the
first
monarch
of
the
Indian
state.
Right
to
the
port
the
valiant
GAMA
bonds,
With
joyful
shouts,
a
fleet
of
boats
attends:
Joyful,
their
nets
they
leave
and
finny
prey,
And,
crowding
round
the
Lusians,
point
the
way.
A
herald
now,
by
VASCO'S
high
command
Sent
to
the
monarch,
treads
the
Indian
strand;
The
sacred
staff
he
bears,
in
gold
he
shines,
And
tells
his
office
by
majestic
signs.
As,
to
and
fro,
recumbent
to
the
gale,
The
harvest
waves
along
the
yellow
dale,
So,
round
the
herald
press
the
wond'ring
throng,
Recumbent
waving
as
they
pour
along,
And
much
his
manly
port
and
strange
attire,
And
much
his
fair
and
ruddy
hue
admire:
When,
speeding
through
the
crowd,
with
eager
haste,
And
honest
smiles,
a
son
of
Afric
press'd;
Enrapt
with
joy
the
wond'ring
herald
hears
Castilia's
manly
tongue
salute
his
ears.[459]
"What
friendly
angel
from
thy
Tago's
shore
Has
led
thee
hither?"
cries
the
joyful
Moor.
Then,
hand
in
hand
(the
pledge
of
faith)
conjoin'd--
"Oh
joy
beyond
the
dream
of
hope
to
find,
To
hear
a
kindred
voice,"
the
Lusian
cried,
"Beyond
unmeasur'd
gulfs
and
seas
untried;
Untried,
before
our
daring
keels
explor'd
Our
fearless
way!
O
Heav'n,
what
tempests
roar'd,
While,
round
the
vast
of
Afric's
southmost
land,
Our
eastward
bowsprits
sought
the
Indian
strand!"
Amaz'd,
o'erpower'd,
the
friendly
stranger
stood--
"A
path
now
open'd
through
the
boundless
flood!
The
hope
of
ages,
and
the
dread
despair,
Accomplish'd
now,
and
conquer'd!"--Stiff
his
hair
Rose
thrilling,
while
his
lab'ring
thoughts
pursued
The
dreadful
course
by
GAMA'S
fate
subdued.
Homeward,
with
gen'rous
warmth
o'erflow'd,
he
leads
The
Lusian
guest,
and
swift
the
feast
succeeds;
The
purple
grape,
and
golden
fruitage
smile;
And
each
choice
viand
of
the
Indian
soil
Heap'd
o'er
the
board,
the
master's
zeal
declare;
The
social
feast
the
guest
and
master
share:
The
sacred
pledge
of
eastern
faith[460]
approv'd,
By
wrath
unalter'd,
and
by
wrong
unmov'd.
Now,
to
the
fleet
the
joyful
herald
bends,
With
earnest
pace
the
Heav'n-sent
friend
attends:
Now,
down
the
river's
sweepy
stream
they
glide,
And
now,
their
pinnace
cuts
the
briny
tide:
The
Moor,
with
transport
sparkling
in
his
eyes,
The
well-known
make
of
GAMA'S
navy
spies,
The
bending
bowsprit,
and
the
mast
so
tall,
The
sides
black,
frowning
as
a
castle
wall,
The
high-tower'd
stern,
the
lordly
nodding
prore,
And
the
broad
standard
slowly
waving
o'er
The
anchor's
moony[461]
fangs.
The
skiff
he
leaves,
Brave
GAMA'S
deck
his
bounding
step
receives;
And,
"Hail!"
he
cries:
in
transport
GAMA
sprung,
And
round
his
neck
with
friendly
welcome
hung;
Enrapt,
so
distant
o'er
the
dreadful
main,
To
hear
the
music
of
the
tongue
of
Spain.
And
now,
beneath
a
painted
shade
of
state,
Beside
the
admiral,
the
stranger
sat.
Of
India's
clime,
the
natives,
and
the
laws,
What
monarch
sways
them,
what
religion
awes?
Why
from
the
tombs
devoted
to
his
sires
The
son
so
far?
the
valiant
chief
inquires.
In
act
to
speak
the
stranger
waves
his
hand,
The
joyful
crew
in
silent
wonder
stand,
Each
gently
pressing
on,
with
greedy
ear,
As
erst
the
bending
forests
stoop'd
to
hear
In
Rhodope,[462]
when
Orpheus'
heavenly
strain,
Deplor'd
his
lost
Eurydice
in
vain;
While,
with
a
mien
that
gen'rous
friendship
won
From
ev'ry
heart,
the
stranger
thus
began:--
"Your
glorious
deeds,
ye
Lusians,
well
I
know,
To
neighb'ring
earth
the
vital
air
I
owe;
Yet--though
my
faith
the
Koran's
lore
revere;
So
taught
my
sires;
my
birth
at
proud
Tangier,
A
hostile
clime
to
Lisbon's
awful
name--
I
glow,
enraptur'd,
o'er
the
Lusian
fame;
Proud
though
your
nation's
warlike
glories
shine,
These
proudest
honours
yield,
O
chief,
to
thine;
Beneath
thy
dread
achievements
low
they
fall,
And
India's
shore,
discover'd,
crowns
them
all.
Won
by
your
fame,
by
fond
affection
sway'd,
A
friend
I
come,
and
offer
friendship's
aid.
As,
on
my
lips
Castilia's
language
glows,
So,
from
my
tongue
the
speech
of
India
flows:
Mozaide
my
name,
in
India's
court
belov'd,
For
honest
deeds
(but
time
shall
speak)
approv'd.
When
India's
monarch
greets
his
court
again,
(For
now
the
banquet
on
the
tented
plain:
And
sylvan
chase
his
careless
hours
employ),[463]
When
India's
mighty
lord,
with
wond'ring
joy,
Shall
hail
you
welcome
on
his
spacious
shore
Through
oceans
never
plough'd
by
keel
before,
Myself
shall
glad
interpreter
attend,
Mine
ev'ry
office
of
the
faithful
friend.
Ah!
but
a
stream,
the
labour
of
the
oar,
Divides
my
birthplace
from
your
native
shore;
On
shores
unknown,
in
distant
worlds,
how
sweet
The
kindred
tongue,
the
kindred
face,
to
greet!
Such
now
my
joy;
and
such,
O
Heav'n,
be
yours!
Yes,
bounteous
Heav'n
your
glad
success
secures.
Till
now
impervious,
Heav'n
alone
subdued
The
various
horrors
of
the
trackless
flood:
Heav'n
sent
you
here
for
some
great
work
divine,
And
Heav'n
inspires
my
breast
your
sacred
toils
to
join.
"Vast
are
the
shores
of
India's
wealthful
soil;
Southward
sea-girt
she
forms
a
demi-isle:
His
cavern'd
cliffs
with
dark-brow'd
forests
crown'd,
Hemodian
Taurus[464]
frowns
her
northern
bound:
From
Caspia's
lake
th'
enormous
mountain[464]
spreads,
And,
bending
eastward,
rears
a
thousand
heads:
Far
to
extremest
sea
the
ridges
thrown,
By
various
names,
through
various
tribes
are
known:
Here
down
the
waste
of
Taurus'
rocky
side
Two
infant
rivers
pour
the
crystal
tide,
Indus
the
one,
and
one
the
Ganges
nam'd,
Darkly
of
old
through
distant
nations
fam'd:
One
eastward
curving
holds
his
crooked
way,
One
to
the
west
gives
his
swoll'n
tide
to
stray:
Declining
southward
many
a
land
they
lave,
And,
widely
swelling,
roll
the
sea-like
wave,
Till
the
twin
offspring
of
the
mountain
sire
Both
in
the
Indian
deep
engulf'd
expire:
Between
these
streams,
fair
smiling
to
the
day,
The
Indian
lands
their
wide
domains
display,
And
many
a
league,
far
to
the
south
they
bend,
From
the
broad
region
where
the
rivers
end,
Till,
where
the
shores
to
Ceylon's
isle
oppose,
In
conic
form
the
Indian
regions
close.
To
various
laws
the
various
tribes
incline,
And
various
are
the
rites
esteem'd
divine:
Some,
as
from
Heav'n,
receive
the
Koran's
lore,
Some
the
dread
monsters
of
the
wild
adore;
Some
bend
to
wood
and
stone
the
prostrate
head,
And
rear
unhallow'd
altars
to
the
dead.
By
Ganges'
banks,
as
wild
traditions
tell,[465]
Of
old
the
tribes
liv'd
healthful
by
the
smell;
No
food
they
knew,
such
fragrant
vapours
rose
Rich
from
the
flow'ry
lawns
where
Ganges
flows:
Here
now
the
Delhian,
and
the
fierce
Pathàn,
Feed
their
fair
flocks;
and
here,
a
heathen
clan,
Stern
Dekhan's
sons
the
fertile
valleys
till,
A
clan,
whose
hope
to
shun
eternal
ill,
Whose
trust
from
ev'ry
stain
of
guilt
to
save,
Is
fondly
plac'd
in
Ganges'
holy
wave;[466]
If
to
the
stream
the
breathless
corpse
be
giv'n
They
deem
the
spirit
wings
her
way
to
heav'n.
Here
by
the
mouths,
where
hallow'd
Ganges
ends,
Bengala's
beauteous
Eden
wide
extends,
Unrivall'd
smile
her
fair
luxurious
vales:
And
here
Cambaya[467]
spreads
her
palmy
dales;
A
warlike
realm,
where
still
the
martial
race
From
Porus,[468]
fam'd
of
yore,
their
lineage
trace.
Narsinga[469]
here
displays
her
spacious
line,
In
native
gold
her
sons
and
ruby
shine:
Alas,
how
vain!
these
gaudy
sons
of
fear,
Trembling,
bow
down
before
each
hostile
spear.
And
now,
behold!"--and
while
he
spoke
he
rose,
Now,
with
extended
arm,
the
prospect
shows,--
"Behold
these
mountain
tops
of
various
size
Blend
their
dim
ridges
with
the
fleecy
skies:
Nature's
rude
wall,
against
the
fierce
Canar[470]
They
guard
the
fertile
lawns
of
Malabar.
Here,
from
the
mountain
to
the
surgy
main,
Fair
as
a
garden,
spreads
the
smiling
plain:
And
lo,
the
empress
of
the
Indian
powers,
Their
lofty
Calicut,
resplendent
towers;
Hers
ev'ry
fragrance
of
the
spicy
shore,
Hers
ev'ry
gem
of
India's
countless
store:
Great
Samoreem,
her
lord's
imperial
style,
The
mighty
lord
of
India's
utmost
soil:
To
him
the
kings
their
duteous
tribute
pay,
And,
at
his
feet,
confess
their
borrow'd
sway.
Yet
higher
tower'd
the
monarchs
ancients
boast,
Of
old
one
sov'reign
rul'd
the
spacious
coast.
A
votive
train,
who
brought
the
Koran's
lore,
(What
time
great
Perimal
the
sceptre
bore),
From
blest
Arabia's
groves
to
India
came;
Life
were
their
words,
their
eloquence
a
flame
Of
holy
zeal:
fir'd
by
the
powerful
strain,
The
lofty
monarch
joins
the
faithful
train,
And
vows,
at
fair
Medina's[471]
shrine,
to
close
His
life's
mild
eve
in
prayer,
and
sweet
repose.
Gifts
he
prepares
to
deck
the
prophet's
tomb,
The
glowing
labours
of
the
Indian
loom,
Orissa's
spices,
and
Golconda's
gems;
Yet,
e'er
the
fleet
th'
Arabian
ocean
stems,
His
final
care
his
potent
regions
claim,
Nor
his
the
transport
of
a
father's
name:
His
servants,
now,
the
regal
purple
wear,
And,
high
enthron'd,
the
golden
sceptres
bear.
Proud
Cochim
one,
and
one
fair
Chalé
sways,
The
spicy
isle
another
lord
obeys;
Coulam
and
Cananoor's
luxurious
fields,
And
Cranganore
to
various
lords
he
yields.
While
these,
and
others
thus
the
monarch
grac'd,
A
noble
youth
his
care
unmindful
pass'd:
Save
Calicut,
a
city
poor
and
small,
Though
lordly
now,
no
more
remain'd
to
fall:
Griev'd
to
behold
such
merit
thus
repaid,
The
sapient
youth
the
'king
of
kings'
he
made,
And,
honour'd
with
the
name,
great
Zamoreem,
The
lordly,
titled
boast
of
power
supreme.
And
now,
great
Perimal[472]
resigns
his
reign,
The
blissful
bowers
of
Paradise
to
gain:
Before
the
gale
his
gaudy
navy
flies,
And
India
sinks
for
ever
from
his
eyes.
And
soon
to
Calicut's
commodious
port
The
fleets,
deep-edging
with
the
wave,
resort:
Wide
o'er
the
shore
extend
the
warlike
piles,
And
all
the
landscape
round
luxurious
smiles.
And
now,
her
flag
to
ev'ry
gale
unfurl'd,
She
towers,
the
empress
of
the
eastern
world:
Such
are
the
blessings
sapient
kings
bestow,
And
from
thy
stream
such
gifts,
O
Commerce,
flow.
"From
that
sage
youth,
who
first
reign'd
'king
of
kings,'
He
now
who
sways
the
tribes
of
India
springs.
Various
the
tribes,
all
led
by
fables
vain,
Their
rites
the
dotage
of
the
dreamful
brain.
All,
save
where
Nature
whispers
modest
care,
Naked,
they
blacken
in
the
sultry
air.
The
haughty
nobles
and
the
vulgar
race
Never
must
join
the
conjugal
embrace;
Nor
may
the
stripling,
nor
the
blooming
maid,
(Oh,
lost
to
joy,
by
cruel
rites
betray'd!)
To
spouse
of
other
than
their
father's
art,
At
Love's
connubial
shrine
unite
the
heart:
Nor
may
their
sons
(the
genius
and
the
view
Confin'd
and
fetter'd)
other
art
pursue.
Vile
were
the
stain,
and
deep
the
foul
disgrace,
Should
other
tribe
touch
one
of
noble
race;
A
thousand
rites,
and
washings
o'er
and
o'er,
Can
scarce
his
tainted
purity
restore.
Poleas[473]
the
lab'ring
lower
clans
are
nam'd:
By
the
proud
Nayres
the
noble
rank
is
claim'd;
The
toils
of
culture,
and
of
art
they
scorn,
The
warrior's
plumes
their
haughty
brows
adorn;
The
shining
falchion
brandish'd
in
the
right,
Their
left
arm
wields
the
target
in
the
fight;
Of
danger
scornful,
ever
arm'd
they
stand
Around
the
king,
a
stern
barbarian
band.
Whate'er
in
India
holds
the
sacred
name
Of
piety
or
lore,
the
Brahmins
claim:
In
wildest
rituals,
vain
and
painful,
lost,
Brahma,[474]
their
founder,
as
a
god
they
boast.[475]
To
crown
their
meal
no
meanest
life
expires,
Pulse,
fruit,
and
herbs
alone
their
board
requires:
Alone,
in
lewdness
riotous
and
free,
No
spousal
ties
withhold,
and
no
degree:
Lost
to
the
heart-ties,
to
his
neighbour's
arms,
The
willing
husband
yields
his
spouse's
charms:
In
unendear'd
embraces
free
they
blend;
Yet,
but
the
husband's
kindred
may
ascend
The
nuptial
couch:
alas,
too
blest,
they
know
}
Nor
jealousy's
suspense,
nor
burning
woe;
}
The
bitter
drops
which
oft
from
dear
affection
flow.
}
But,
should
my
lips
each
wond'rous
scene
unfold,
Which
your
glad
eyes
will
soon
amaz'd
behold,
Oh,
long
before
the
various
tale
could
run,
Deep
in
the
west
would
sink
yon
eastern
sun.
In
few,
all
wealth
from
China
to
the
Nile,
All
balsams,
fruit,
and
gold
on
India's
bosom
smile."
While
thus,
the
Moor
his
faithful
tale
reveal'd,
Wide
o'er
the
coast
the
voice
of
Rumour
swell'd;
As,
first
some
upland
vapour
seems
to
float
Small
as
the
smoke
of
lonely
shepherd
cote,
Soon
o'er
the
dales
the
rolling
darkness
spreads,
And
wraps
in
hazy
clouds
the
mountain
heads,
The
leafless
forest
and
the
utmost
lea;
And
wide
its
black
wings
hover
o'er
the
sea:
The
tear-dropp'd
bough
hangs
weeping
in
the
vale,
And
distant
navies
rear
the
mist-wet
sail.
So,
Fame
increasing,
loud
and
louder
grew,
And
to
the
sylvan
camp
resounding
flew:
"A
lordly
band,"
she
cries,
"of
warlike
mien,
Of
face
and
garb
in
India
never
seen,
Of
tongue
unknown,
through
gulfs
undar'd
before,
Unknown
their
aim,
have
reach'd
the
Indian
shore."
To
hail
their
chief
the
Indian
lord
prepares,
And
to
the
fleet
he
sends
his
banner'd
Nayres:
As
to
the
bay
the
nobles
press
along,
The
wond'ring
city
pours
th'
unnumber'd
throng.
And
now
brave
GAMA,
and
his
splendid
train,
Himself
adorn'd
in
all
the
pride
of
Spain,
In
gilded
barges
slowly
bend
to
shore,
While
to
the
lute
the
gently
falling
oar
Now,
breaks
the
surges
of
the
briny
tide,
And
now,
the
strokes
the
cold
fresh
stream
divide.
Pleas'd
with
the
splendour
of
the
Lusian
band,
On
every
bank
the
crowded
thousands
stand.
Begirt
with,
high-plum'd
nobles,
by
the
flood
The
first
great
minister
of
India
stood,
The
Catual[476]
his
name
in
India's
tongue:
To
GAMA
swift
the
lordly
regent
sprung;
His
open
arms
the
valiant
chief
enfold,
And
now
he
lands
him
on
the
shore
of
gold:
With
pomp
unwonted
India's
nobles
greet
The
fearless
heroes
of
the
warlike
fleet.
A
couch
on
shoulders
borne,
in
India's
mode,
(With
gold
the
canopy
and
purple
glow'd),
Receives
the
Lusian
captain;
equal
rides
The
lordly
catual,
and
onward
guides,
While
GAMA'S
train,
and
thousands
of
the
throng
Of
India's
sons,
encircling,
pour
along.
To
hold
discourse
in
various
tongues
they
try;
In
vain;
the
accents
unremember'd
die,
Instant
as
utter'd.
Thus,
on
Babel's
plain
Each
builder
heard
his
mate,
and
heard
in
vain.
GAMA
the
while,
and
India's
second
lord,
Hold
glad
responses,
as
the
various
word
The
faithful
Moor
unfolds.
The
city
gate
They
pass'd,
and
onward,
tower'd
in
sumptuous
state,
Before
them
now
the
sacred
temple
rose;
The
portals
wide
the
sculptur'd
shrines
disclose.
The
chiefs
advance,
and,
enter'd
now,
behold
The
gods
of
wood,
cold
stone,
and
shining
gold;
Various
of
figure,
and
of
various
face,
As
the
foul
demon
will'd
the
likeness
base.
Taught
to
behold
the
rays
of
godhead
shine
Fair
imag'd
in
the
human
face
divine,
With
sacred
horror
thrill'd,
the
Lusians
view'd
The
monster
forms,
Chimera-like,
and
rude.[477]
Here,
spreading
horns
a
human
visage
bore,
So,
frown'd
stern
Jove
in
Lybia's
fane
of
yore.
One
body
here
two
various
faces
rear'd;
So,
ancient
Janus
o'er
his
shrine
appear'd.
A
hundred
arms
another
brandish'd
wide;
So,
Titan's
son[478]
the
race
of
heaven
defied.
And
here,
a
dog
his
snarling
tusks
display'd;
Anubis,
thus
in
Memphis'
hallow'd
shade
Grinn'd
horrible.
With
vile
prostrations
low
Before
these
shrines
the
blinded
Indians
bow.[479]
And
now,
again
the
splendid
pomp
proceeds;
To
India's
lord
the
haughty
regent
leads.
To
view
the
glorious
leader
of
the
fleet
Increasing
thousands
swell
o'er
every
street;
High
o'er
the
roofs
the
struggling
youths
ascend,
The
hoary
fathers
o'er
the
portals
bend,
The
windows
sparkle
with
the
glowing
blaze
Of
female
eyes,
and
mingling
diamond's
rays.
And
now,
the
train
with
solemn
state
and
slow,
Approach
the
royal
gate,
through
many
a
row
Of
fragrant
wood-walks,
and
of
balmy
bowers,
Radiant
with
fruitage,
ever
gay
with
flowers.
Spacious
the
dome
its
pillar'd
grandeur
spread,
Nor
to
the
burning
day
high
tower'd
the
head;
The
citron
groves
around
the
windows
glow'd,
And
branching
palms
their
grateful
shade
bestow'd;
The
mellow
light
a
pleasing
radiance
cast;
The
marble
walls
Dædalian
sculpture
grac'd
Here
India's
fate,[480]
from
darkest
times
of
old,
The
wondrous
artist
on
the
stone
enroll'd;
Here,
o'er
the
meadows,
by
Hydaspes'
stream,
In
fair
array
the
marshall'd
legions
seem:
A
youth
of
gleeful
eye
the
squadrons
led,
Smooth
was
his
cheek,
and
glow'd
with
purest
red:
Around
his
spear
the
curling
vine-leaves
wav'd;
And,
by
a
streamlet
of
the
river
lav'd,
Behind
her
founder,
Nysa's
walls
were
rear'd;[481]
So
breathing
life
the
ruddy
god
appear'd,
Had
Semele
beheld
the
smiling
boy,[482]
The
mother's
heart
had
proudly
heav'd
with
joy.
Unnumber'd
here,
were
seen
th'
Assyrian
throng,
That
drank
whole
rivers
as
they
march'd
along:
Each
eye
seem'd
earnest
on
their
warrior
queen,[483]
High
was
her
port,
and
furious
was
her
mien;
Her
valour
only
equall'd
by
her
lust;
Fast
by
her
side
her
courser
paw'd
the
dust,
Her
son's
vile
rival;
reeking
to
the
plain
Fell
the
hot
sweat-drops
as
he
champ'd
the
rein.
And
here
display'd,
most
glorious
to
behold,
The
Grecian
banners,
op'ning
many
a
fold,
Seem'd
trembling
on
the
gale;
at
distance
far
The
Ganges
lav'd
the
wide-extended
war.
Here,
the
blue
marble
gives
the
helmets'
gleam;
Here,
from
the
cuirass
shoots
the
golden
beam.
A
proud-eyed
youth,
with
palms
unnumber'd
gay,
Of
the
bold
veterans
led
the
brown
array;
Scornful
of
mortal
birth
enshrin'd
he
rode,
Call'd
Jove
his
father,[484]
and
assum'd
the
god.
While
dauntless
GAMA
and
his
train
survey'd
The
sculptur'd
walls,
the
lofty
regent
said:
"For
nobler
wars
than
these
you
wond'ring
see
That
ample
space
th'
eternal
fates
decree:
Sacred
to
these
th'
unpictur'd
wall
remains,
Unconscious
yet
of
vanquish'd
India's
chains.
Assur'd
we
know
the
awful
day
shall
come,
Big
with
tremendous
fate,
and
India's
doom.
The
sons
of
Brahma,
by
the
god
their
sire
Taught
to
illume
the
dread
divining
fire,
From
the
drear
mansions
of
the
dark
abodes
Awake
the
dead,
or
call
th'
infernal
gods;
Then,
round
the
flame,
while
glimm'ring
ghastly
blue,
Behold
the
future
scene
arise
to
view.
The
sons
of
Brahma,
in
the
magic
hour,
Beheld
the
foreign
foe
tremendous
lower;
Unknown
their
tongue,
their
face,
and
strange
attire,
And
their
bold
eye-balls
burn'd
with
warlike
ire:
They
saw
the
chief
o'er
prostrate
India
rear
The
glitt'ring
terrors
of
his
awful
spear.
But,
swift
behind
these
wint'ry
days
of
woe
A
spring
of
joy
arose
in
liveliest
glow,
Such
gentle
manners,
leagued
with
wisdom,
reign'd
In
the
dread
victors,
and
their
rage
restrain'd.
Beneath
their
sway
majestic,
wise,
and
mild,
Proud
of
her
victors'
laws,
thrice
happier
India
smil'd.
So,
to
the
prophets
of
the
Brahmin
train
The
visions
rose,
that
never
rose
in
vain."
The
regent
ceas'd;
and
now,
with
solemn
pace,
The
chiefs
approach
the
regal
hall
of
grace.
The
tap'stried
walls
with
gold
were
pictur'd
o'er,
And
flow'ry
velvet
spread
the
marble
floor.[485]
In
all
the
grandeur
of
the
Indian
state,
High
on
a
blazing
couch,
the
monarch
sat,
With
starry
gems
the
purple
curtains
shin'd,
And
ruby
flowers
and
golden
foliage
twin'd
Around
the
silver
pillars:
high
o'er
head
The
golden
canopy
its
radiance
shed:
Of
cloth
of
gold
the
sov'reign's
mantle
shone,
And,
his
high
turban
flam'd
with
precious
stone
Sublime
and
awful
was
his
sapient
mien,
Lordly
his
posture,
and
his
brow
serene.
A
hoary
sire,
submiss
on
bended
knee,
(Low
bow'd
his
head),
in
India's
luxury,
A
leaf,[486]
all
fragrance
to
the
glowing
taste,
Before
the
king
each
little
while
replac'd.
The
patriarch
Brahmin
(soft
and
slow
he
rose),
Advancing
now,
to
lordly
GAMA
bows,
And
leads
him
to
the
throne;
in
silent
state
The
monarch's
nod
assigns
the
captain's
seat;
The
Lusian
train
in
humbler
distance
stand:
Silent,
the
monarch
eyes
the
foreign
band
With
awful
mien;
when
valiant
GAMA
broke
The
solemn
pause,
and
thus
majestic
spoke:--
"From
where
the
crimson
sun
of
ev'ning
laves
His
blazing
chariot
in
the
western
waves,
I
come,
the
herald
of
a
mighty
king,
And,
holy
vows
of
lasting
friendship
bring
To
thee,
O
monarch,
for
resounding
Fame
Far
to
the
west
has
borne
thy
princely
name;
All
India's
sov'reign
thou!
Nor
deem
I
sue,
Great
as
thou
art,
the
humble
suppliant's
due.
Whate'er
from
western
Tagus
to
the
Nile,
Inspires
the
monarch's
wish,
the
merchant's
toil,
From
where
the
north-star
gleams
o'er
seas
of
frost,
To
Ethiopia's
utmost
burning
coast,
Whate'er
the
sea,
whate'er
the
land
bestows,
In
my
great
monarch's
realm
unbounded
flows.
Pleas'd
thy
high
grandeur
and
renown
to
hear,
My
sov'reign
offers
friendship's
bands
sincere:
Mutual
he
asks
them,
naked
of
disguise,
Then,
every
bounty
of
the
smiling
skies
Shower'd
on
his
shore
and
thine,
in
mutual
flow,
Shall
joyful
Commerce
on
each
shore
bestow.
Our
might
in
war,
what
vanquish'd
nations
fell
Beneath
our
spear,
let
trembling
Afric
tell;
Survey
my
floating
towers,
and
let
thine
ear,
Dread
as
it
roars,
our
battle-thunder
hear.
If
friendship
then
thy
honest
wish
explore,
That
dreadful
thunder
on
thy
foes
shall
roar.
Our
banners
o'er
the
crimson
field
shall
sweep,
And
our
tall
navies
ride
the
foamy
deep,
Till
not
a
foe
against
thy
land
shall
rear
Th'
invading
bowsprit,
or
the
hostile
spear:
My
king,
thy
brother,
thus
thy
wars
shall
join,
The
glory
his,
the
gainful
harvest
thine."
Brave
GAMA
spake;
the
pagan
king
replies,
"From
lands
which
now
behold
the
morning
rise,
While
eve's
dim
clouds
the
Indian
sky
enfold,
Glorious
to
us
an
offer'd
league
we
hold.
Yet
shall
our
will
in
silence
rest
unknown,
Till
what
your
land,
and
who
the
king
you
own,
Our
council
deeply
weigh.
Let
joy
the
while,
And
the
glad
feast,
the
fleeting
hours
beguile.
Ah!
to
the
wearied
mariner,
long
toss'd
O'er
briny
waves,
how
sweet
the
long-sought
coast!
The
night
now
darkens;
on
the
friendly
shore
Let
soft
repose
your
wearied
strength
restore,
Assur'd
an
answer
from
our
lips
to
bear,
Which,
not
displeas'd,
your
sov'reign
lord
shall
hear.
More
now
we
add
not."[487]
From
the
hall
of
state
Withdrawn,
they
now
approach
the
regent's
gate;
The
sumptuous
banquet
glows;
all
India's
pride
Heap'd
on
the
board
the
royal
feast
supplied.
Now,
o'er
the
dew-drops
of
the
eastern
lawn
Gleam'd
the
pale
radiance
of
the
star
of
dawn,
The
valiant
GAMA
on
his
couch
repos'd,
And
balmy
rest
each
Lusian
eye-lid
clos'd:
When
the
high
catual,
watchful
to
fulfil
The
cautious
mandates
of
his
sov'reign's
will,
In
secret
converse
with
the
Moor
retires;
And,
earnest,
much
of
Lusus'
sons
inquires;
What
laws,
what
holy
rites,
what
monarch
sway'd
The
warlike
race?
When
thus
the
just
Mozaide:--
"The
land
from
whence
these
warriors
well
I
know,
(To
neighb'ring
earth
my
hapless
birth
I
owe)
Illustrious
Spain,
along
whose
western
shores
Grey-dappled
eve
the
dying
twilight
pours.--
A
wondrous
prophet
gave
their
holy
lore,
The
godlike
seer
a
virgin
mother
bore,
Th'
Eternal
Spirit
on
the
human
race
(So
be
they
taught)
bestow'd
such
awful
grace.
In
war
unmatch'd,
they
rear
the
trophied
crest:
What
terrors
oft
have
thrill'd
my
infant
breast[488]
When
their
brave
deeds
my
wond'ring
fathers
told;
How
from
the
lawns,
where,
crystalline
and
cold,
The
Guadiana
rolls
his
murm'ring
tide,
And
those
where,
purple
by
the
Tago's
side,
The
length'ning
vineyards
glisten
o'er
the
field,
Their
warlike
sires
my
routed
sires
expell'd:
Nor
paus'd
their
rage;
the
furious
seas
they
brav'd,
Nor
loftiest
walls,
nor
castled
mountains
saved;
Round
Afric's
thousand
bays
their
navies
rode,
And
their
proud
armies
o'er
our
armies
trod.
Nor
less,
let
Spain
through
all
her
kingdoms
own,
O'er
other
foes
their
dauntless
valour
shone:
Let
Gaul
confess,
her
mountain-ramparts
wild,
Nature
in
vain
the
hoar
Pyrenians
pil'd.
No
foreign
lance
could
e'er
their
rage
restrain,
Unconquer'd
still
the
warrior
race
remain.
More
would
you
hear,
secure
your
care
may
trust
The
answer
of
their
lips,
so
nobly
just,
Conscious
of
inward
worth,
of
manners
plain,
Their
manly
souls
the
gilded
lie
disdain.
Then,
let
thine
eyes
their
lordly
might
admire,
And
mark
the
thunder
of
their
arms
of
fire:
The
shore,
with
trembling,
hears
the
dreadful
sound,
And
rampir'd
walls
lie
smoking
on
the
ground.
Speed
to
the
fleet;
their
arts,
their
prudence
weigh,
How
wise
in
peace,
in
war
how
dread,
survey."
With
keen
desire
the
craftful
pagan
burn'd
Soon
as
the
morn
in
orient
blaze
return'd,
To
view
the
fleet
his
splendid
train
prepares;
And
now,
attended
by
the
lordly
Nayres,
The
shore
they
cover,
now
the
oarsmen
sweep
The
foamy
surface
of
the
azure
deep:
And
now,
brave
Paulus
gives
the
friendly
hand,
And
high
on
GAMA'S
lofty
deck
they
stand.
Bright
to
the
day
the
purple
sail-cloths
glow,
Wide
to
the
gale
the
silken
ensigns
flow;
The
pictur'd
flags
display
the
warlike
strife;
Bold
seem
the
heroes,
as
inspir'd
by
life.
Here,
arm
to
arm,
the
single
combat
strains,
Here,
burns
the
combat
on
the
tented
plains
General
and
fierce;
the
meeting
lances
thrust,
And
the
black
blood
seems
smoking
on
the
dust.
With
earnest
eyes
the
wond'ring
regent
views
The
pictur'd
warriors,
and
their
history
sues.
But
now
the
ruddy
juice,
by
Noah
found,[489]
In
foaming
goblets
circled
swiftly
round,
And
o'er
the
deck
swift
rose
the
festive
board;
Yet,
smiling
oft,
refrains
the
Indian
lord:
His
faith
forbade
with
other
tribe
to
join
The
sacred
meal,
esteem'd
a
rite
divine.[490]
In
bold
vibrations,
thrilling
on
the
ear,
The
battle
sounds
the
Lusian
trumpets
rear;
Loud
burst
the
thunders
of
the
arms
of
fire,
Slow
round
the
sails
the
clouds
of
smoke
aspire,
And
rolling
their
dark
volumes
o'er
the
day
The
Lusian
war,
in
dreadful
pomp,
display.
In
deepest
thought
the
careful
regent
weigh'd
The
pomp
and
power
at
GAMA'S
nod
bewray'd;
Yet,
seem'd
alone
in
wonder
to
behold
The
glorious
heroes,
and
the
wars
half
told
In
silent
poesy.--Swift
from
the
board
High
crown'd
with
wine,
uprose
the
Indian
lord;
Both
the
bold
GAMAS,
and
their
gen'rous
peer,
The
brave
Coello,
rose,
prepar'd
to
hear
Or,
ever
courteous,
give
the
meet
reply:
Fix'd
and
inquiring
was
the
regent's
eye:
The
warlike
image
of
a
hoary
sire,
Whose
name
shall
live
till
earth
and
time
expire,
His
wonder
fix'd,
and
more
than
human
glow'd
The
hero's
look;
his
robes
of
Grecian
mode;
A
bough,
his
ensign,
in
his
right
he
wav'd,
A
leafy
bough.--But
I,
fond
man
depraved!
Where
would
I
speed,
as
madd'ning
in
a
dream,
Without
your
aid,
ye
Nymphs
of
Tago's
stream!
Or
yours,
ye
Dryads
of
Mondego's
bowers!
Without
your
aid
how
vain
my
wearied
powers!
Long
yet,
and
various
lies
my
arduous
way
Through
low'ring
tempests
and
a
boundless
sea.
Oh
then,
propitious
hear
your
son
implore,
And
guide
my
vessel
to
the
happy
shore.
Ah!
see
how
long
what
perilous
days,
what
woes
On
many
a
foreign
coast
around
me
rose,
As,
dragg'd
by
Fortune's
chariot-wheels
along,
I
sooth'd
my
sorrows
with
the
warlike
song:[491]
Wide
ocean's
horrors
length'ning
now
around,
And,
now
my
footsteps
trod
the
hostile
ground;
Yet,
mid
each
danger
of
tumultuous
war
Your
Lusian
heroes
ever
claim'd
my
care:
As
Canace[492]
of
old,
ere
self-destroy'd,
One
hand
the
pen,
and
one
the
sword
employ'd,
Degraded
now,
by
poverty
abhorr'd,
The
guest
dependent
at
the
lordling's
board:
Now
blest
with
all
the
wealth
fond
hope
could
crave,
Soon
I
beheld
that
wealth
beneath
the
wave
For
ever
lost;[493]
myself
escap'd
alone,
On
the
wild
shore
all
friendless,
hopeless,
thrown;
My
life,
like
Judah's
heaven-doom'd
king
of
yore,[494]
By
miracle
prolong'd;
yet
not
the
more
To
end
my
sorrows:
woes
succeeding
woes
Belied
my
earnest
hopes
of
sweet
repose:
In
place
of
bays
around
my
brows
to
shed
Their
sacred
honours,
o'er
my
destin'd
head
Foul
Calumny
proclaim'd
the
fraudful
tale,
And
left
me
mourning
in
a
dreary
jail.[495]
Such
was
the
meed,
alas!
on
me
bestow'd,
}
Bestow'd
by
those
for
whom
my
numbers
glow'd,
}
By
those
who
to
my
toils
their
laurel
honours
ow'd.
}
Ye
gentle
nymphs
of
Tago's
rosy
bowers,
Ah,
see
what
letter'd
patron-lords
are
yours!
Dull
as
the
herds
that
graze
their
flow'ry
dales,
To
them
in
vain
the
injur'd
muse
bewails:
No
fost'ring
care
their
barb'rous
hands
bestow,
Though
to
the
muse
their
fairest
fame
they
owe.
Ah,
cold
may
prove
the
future
priest
of
fame
Taught
by
my
fate:
yet,
will
I
not
disclaim
Your
smiles,
ye
muses
of
Mondego's
shade;
Be
still
my
dearest
joy
your
happy
aid!
And
hear
my
vow:
Nor
king,
nor
loftiest
peer
Shall
e'er
from
me
the
song
of
flatt'ry
hear;
Nor
crafty
tyrant,
who
in
office
reigns,
Smiles
on
his
king,
and
binds
the
land
in
chains;
His
king's
worst
foe:
nor
he
whose
raging
ire,
And
raging
wants,
to
shape
his
course,
conspire;
True
to
the
clamours
of
the
blinded
crowd,
Their
changeful
Proteus,
insolent
and
loud:
Nor
he
whose
honest
mien
secures
applause,
Grave
though
he
seem,
and
father
of
the
laws,
Who,
but
half-patriot,
niggardly
denies
Each
other's
merit,
and
withholds
the
prize:
Who
spurns
the
muse,[496]
nor
feels
the
raptur'd
strain,
Useless
by
him
esteem'd,
and
idly
vain:
For
him,
for
these,
no
wreath
my
hand
shall
twine;
On
other
brows
th'
immortal
rays
shall
shine:
He
who
the
path
of
honour
ever
trod,
True
to
his
king,
his
country,
and
his
God,
On
his
blest
head
my
hands
shall
fix
the
crown
Wove
of
the
deathless
laurels
of
renown.

SEVENTH
BOOK.
BOOK
VIII.
THE
ARGUMENT.
Description
of
the
pictures,
given
by
Paulus.
The
heroes
of
Portugal,
from
Lusus,
one
of
the
companions
of
Bacchus
(who
gave
his
name
to
Portugal),
and
Ulysses,
the
founder
of
Lisbon,
down
to
Don
Pedro
and
Don
Henrique
(Henry),
the
conquerors
of
Ceuta,
are
all
represented
in
the
portraits
of
Gama,
and
are
characterized
by
appropriate
verses.
Meanwhile
the
zamorim
has
recourse
to
the
oracles
of
his
false
gods,
who
make
him
acquainted
with
the
future
dominion
of
the
Portuguese
over
India,
and
the
consequent
ruin
of
his
empire.
The
Mohammedan
Arabs
conspire
against
the
Portuguese.
The
zamorim
questions
the
truth
of
Gama's
statement,
and
charges
him
with
being
captain
of
a
band
of
pirates.
Gama
is
obliged
to
give
up
to
the
Indians
the
whole
of
his
merchandise
as
ransom,
when
he
obtains
permission
to
re-embark.
He
seizes
several
merchants
of
Calicut,
whom
he
detains
on
board
his
ship
as
hostages
for
his
two
factors,
who
were
on
land
to
sell
his
merchandise.
He
afterwards
liberates
the
natives,
whom
he
exchanges
for
his
two
companions.
In
Mickle's
translation
this
portion
of
the
original

the
factors
are

in
consequence
of
a
victory
gained
by
Gama.
With
eye
unmov'd
the
silent
CATUAL[497]
view'd
The
pictur'd
sire[498]
with
seeming
life
endu'd;
A
verdant
vine-bough
waving
in
his
right,
Smooth
flow'd
his
sweepy
beard
of
glossy
white,
When
thus,
as
swift
the
Moor
unfolds
the
word,
The
valiant
Paulus
to
the
Indian
lord:--
"Bold
though
these
figures
frown,
yet
bolder
far
These
godlike
heroes
shin'd
in
ancient
war.
In
that
hoar
sire,
of
mien
serene,
august,
Lusus
behold,
no
robber-chief
unjust;
His
cluster'd
bough--the
same
which
Bacchus
bore[499]--
He
waves,
the
emblem
of
his
care
of
yore;
The
friend
of
savage
man,
to
Bacchus
dear,
The
son
of
Bacchus,
or
the
bold
compeer,
What
time
his
yellow
locks
with
vine-leaves
curl'd,
The
youthful
god
subdued
the
savage
world,
Bade
vineyards
glisten
o'er
the
dreary
waste,
And
humaniz'd
the
nations
as
he
pass'd.
Lusus,
the
lov'd
companion
of
the
god,
In
Spain's
fair
bosom
fix'd
his
last
abode,
Our
kingdom
founded,
and
illustrious
reign'd
In
those
fair
lawns,
the
bless'd
Elysium
feign'd,[500]
Where,
winding
oft,
the
Guadiana
roves,
And
Douro
murmurs
through,
the
flow'ry
groves.
Here,
with
his
bones,
he
left
his
deathless
fame,
And
Lusitania's
clime
shall
ever
bear
his
name.
That
other
chief
th'
embroider'd
silk
displays,
Toss'd
o'er
the
deep
whole
years
of
weary
days,
On
Tago's
banks,
at
last,
his
vows
he
paid:
To
wisdom's
godlike
power,
the
Jove-born
maid,[501]
Who
fir'd
his
lips
with
eloquence
divine,
On
Tago's
banks
he
rear'd
the
hallow'd
shrine.
Ulysses
he,
though
fated
to
destroy,
On
Asian
ground,
the
heav'n-built
towers
of
Troy,[502]
On
Europe's
strand,
more
grateful
to
the
skies,
He
bade
th'
eternal
walls
of
Lisbon
rise."[503]
"But
who
that
godlike
terror
of
the
plain,
Who
strews
the
smoking
field
with
heaps
of
slain?
What
num'rous
legions
fly
in
dire
dismay,
Whose
standards
wide
the
eagle's
wings
display?"
The
pagan
asks:
the
brother
chief[504]
replies:--
"Unconquer'd
deem'd,
proud
Rome's
dread
standard
flies,
His
crook
thrown
by,
fir'd
by
his
nation's
woes,
The
hero-shepherd
Viriatus
rose;
His
country
sav'd
proclaim'd
his
warlike
fame,
And
Rome's
wide
empire
trembled
at
his
name.
That
gen'rous
pride
which
Rome
to
Pyrrhus
bore,[505]
To
him
they
show'd
not;
for
they
fear'd
him
more.
Not
on
the
field
o'ercome
by
manly
force,
Peaceful
he
slept;
and
now,
a
murder'd
corse,
By
treason
slain,
he
lay.
How
stern,
behold,
That
other
hero,
firm,
erect,
and
bold:
The
power
by
which
he
boasted
he
divin'd,
Beside
him
pictur'd
stands,
the
milk-white
hind:
Injur'd
by
Rome,
the
stern
Sertorius
fled
To
Tago's
shore,
and
Lusus'
offspring
led;
Their
worth
he
knew;
in
scatter'd
flight
he
drove
The
standards
painted
with
the
birds
of
Jove.
And
lo,
the
flag
whose
shining
colours
own
The
glorious
founder
of
the
Lusian
throne!
Some
deem
the
warrior
of
Hungarian
race,[506]
Some
from
Lorraine
the
godlike
hero
trace.
From
Tagus'
banks
the
haughty
Moor
expell'd,
Galicia's
sons,
and
and
Leon's
warriors
quell'd,
To
weeping
Salem's[507]
ever-hallow'd
meads,
His
warlike
bands
the
holy
Henry
leads;
By
holy
war
to
sanctify
his
crown,
And,
to
his
latest
race,
auspicious
waft
it
down."
"And
who
this
awful
chief?"
aloud
exclaims
The
wond'ring
regent.
"O'er
the
field
he
flames
In
dazzling
steel;
where'er
he
bends
his
course
The
battle
sinks
beneath
his
headlong
force:
Against
his
troops,
though
few,
the
num'rous
foes
In
vain
their
spears
and
tow'ry
walls
oppose.
With
smoking
blood
his
armour
sprinkled
o'er,
High
to
the
knees
his
courser
paws
in
gore:
O'er
crowns
and
blood-stain'd
ensigns
scatter'd
round
He
rides;
his
courser's
brazen
hoofs
resound."
"In
that
great
chief,"
the
second
GAMA
cries,
"The
first
Alonzo[508]
strikes
thy
wond'ring
eyes.
From
Lusus'
realm
the
pagan
Moors
he
drove;
Heav'n,
whom
he
lov'd,
bestow'd
on
him
such
love,
Beneath
him,
bleeding
of
its
mortal
wound,
The
Moorish
strength
lay
prostrate
on
the
ground.
Nor
Ammon's
son,
nor
greater
Julius
dar'd
With
troops
so
few,
with
hosts
so
num'rous
warr'd:
Nor
less
shall
Fame
the
subject
heroes
own:
Behold
that
hoary
warrior's
rageful
frown!
On
his
young
pupil's
flight[509]
his
burning
eyes
He
darts,
and,
'Turn
thy
flying
host,'
he
cries,
'Back
to
the
field!'
The
vet'ran
and
the
boy
Back
to
the
field
exult
with
furious
joy:
Their
ranks
mow'd
down,
the
boastful
foe
recedes,
The
vanquish'd
triumph,
and
the
victor
bleeds.
Again,
that
mirror
of
unshaken
faith,
Egaz
behold,
a
chief
self-doom'd
to
death.[510]
Beneath
Castilia's
sword
his
monarch
lay;
Homage
he
vow'd
his
helpless
king
should
pay;
His
haughty
king
reliev'd,
the
treaty
spurns,
With
conscious
pride
the
noble
Egaz
burns;
His
comely
spouse
and
infant
race
he
leads,
Himself
the
same,
in
sentenced
felons'
weeds,
Around
their
necks
the
knotted
halters
bound,
With
naked
feet
they
tread
the
flinty
ground;
And,
prostrate
now
before
Castilia's
throne,
Their
offer'd
lives
their
monarch's
pride
atone.
Ah
Rome!
no
more
thy
gen'rous
consul
boast.[511]
Whose
'lorn
submission
sav'd
his
ruin'd
host:
No
father's
woes
assail'd
his
stedfast
mind;
The
dearest
ties
the
Lusian
chief
resign'd.
"There,
by
the
stream,
a
town
besieged
behold,
The
Moorish
tents
the
shatter'd
walls
enfold.
Fierce
as
the
lion
from
the
covert
springs,
When
hunger
gives
his
rage
the
whirlwind's
wings;
From
ambush,
lo,
the
valiant
Fuaz
pours,
And
whelms
in
sudden
rout
th'astonish'd
Moors.
The
Moorish
king[512]
in
captive
chains
he
sends;
And,
low
at
Lisbon's
throne,
the
royal
captive
bends.
Fuaz
again
the
artist's
skill
displays;
Far
o'er
the
ocean
shine
his
ensign's
rays:
In
crackling
flames
the
Moorish
galleys
fly,
And
the
red
blaze
ascends
the
blushing
sky:
O'er
Avila's
high
steep
the
flames
aspire,
And
wrap
the
forests
in
a
sheet
of
fire:
There
seem
the
waves
beneath
the
prows
to
boil;
And
distant,
far
around
for
many
a
mile,
The
glassy
deep
reflects
the
ruddy
blaze;
Far
on
the
edge
the
yellow
light
decays,
And
blends
with
hov'ring
blackness.
Great
and
dread
Thus
shone
the
day
when
first
the
combat
bled,
The
first
our
heroes
battled
on
the
main,
The
glorious
prelude
of
our
naval
reign,
Which,
now
the
waves
beyond
the
burning
zone,
And
northern
Greenland's
frost-bound
billows
own.
Again
behold
brave
Fuaz
dares
the
fight!
O'erpower'd
he
sinks
beneath
the
Moorish
might;
Smiling
in
death
the
martyr-hero
lies,
And
lo,
his
soul
triumphant
mounts
the
skies.
Here
now,
behold,
in
warlike
pomp
portray'd,
A
foreign
navy
brings
the
pious
aid.[513]
Lo,
marching
from
the
decks
the
squadrons
spread,
Strange
their
attire,
their
aspect
firm
and
dread.
The
holy
cross
their
ensigns
bold
display,
To
Salem's
aid
they
plough'd
the
wat'ry
way:
Yet
first,
the
cause
the
same,
on
Tago's
shore
They
dye
their
maiden
swords
in
pagan
gore.
Proud
stood
the
Moor
on
Lisbon's
warlike
towers,
From
Lisbon's
walls
they
drive
the
Moorish
powers:
Amid
the
thickest
of
the
glorious
fight,
Lo,
Henry
falls,
a
gallant
German
knight,
A
martyr
falls:
that
holy
tomb
behold,
There
waves
the
blossom'd
palm,
the
boughs
of
gold:
O'er
Henry's
grave
the
sacred
plant
arose,
And
from
the
leaves,[514]
Heav'n's
gift,
gay
health
redundant
flows.
"Aloft,
unfurl!"
the
valiant
Paulus
cries.
Instant,
new
wars
on
new-spread
ensigns
rise
"In
robes
of
white
behold
a
priest
advance![515]
His
sword
in
splinters
smites
the
Moorish
lance:
Arronchez
won
revenges
Lira's
fall:
And
lo,
on
fair
Savilia's
batter'd
wall,
How
boldly
calm,
amid
the
crashing
spears,
That
hero-form
the
Lusian
standard
rears.
There
bleeds
the
war
on
fair
Vandalia's
plain:
Lo,
rushing
through
the
Moors,
o'er
hills
of
slain
The
hero
rides,
and
proves
by
genuine
claim
The
son
of
Egas,[516]
and
his
worth
the
same.
Pierc'd
by
his
dart
the
standard-bearer
dies;
Beneath
his
feet
the
Moorish
standard
lies:
High
o'er
the
field,
behold
the
glorious
blaze!
The
victor-youth
the
Lusian
flag
displays.
Lo,
while
the
moon
through
midnight
azure
rides,
From
the
high
wall
adown
his
spear-staff
glides
The
dauntless
Gerald:[517]
in
his
left
he
bears
Two
watchmen's
heads,
his
right
the
falchion
rears:
The
gate
he
opens,
swift
from
ambush
rise
His
ready
bands,
the
city
falls
his
prize:
Evora
still
the
grateful
honour
pays,
Her
banner'd
flag
the
mighty
deed
displays:
There
frowns
the
hero;
in
his
left
he
bears
The
two
cold
heads,
his
right
the
falchion
rears.
Wrong'd
by
his
king,[518]
and
burning
for
revenge,
Behold
his
arms
that
proud
Castilian
change;
The
Moorish
buckler
on
his
breast
he
bears,
And
leads
the
fiercest
of
the
pagan
spears.
Abrantes
falls
beneath
his
raging
force,
And
now
to
Tagus
bends
his
furious
course.
Another
fate
he
met
on
Tagus'
shore,
Brave
Lopez
from
his
brows
the
laurels
tore;
His
bleeding
army
strew'd
the
thirsty
ground,
And
captive
chains
the
rageful
leader
bound.
Resplendent
far
that
holy
chief
behold!
Aside
he
throws
the
sacred
staff
of
gold,
And
wields
the
spear
of
steel.
How
bold
advance
The
num'rous
Moors,
and
with
the
rested
lance
Hem
round
the
trembling
Lusians.
Calm
and
bold
Still
towers
the
priest,
and
lo,
the
skies
unfold:[519]
Cheer'd
by
the
vision,
brighter
than
the
day,
The
Lusians
trample
down
the
dread
array
Of
Hagar's
legions:
on
the
reeking
plain
Low,
with
their
slaves,
four
haughty
kings
lie
slain.
In
vain
Alcazar
rears
her
brazen
walls,
Before
his
rushing
host
Alcazar
falls.
There,
by
his
altar,
now
the
hero
shines,
And,
with
the
warrior's
palm,
his
mitre
twines.
That
chief
behold:
though
proud
Castilia's
host
He
leads,
his
birth
shall
Tagus
ever
boast.
As
a
pent
flood
bursts
headlong
o'er
the
strand
So
pours
his
fury
o'er
Algarbia's
land:
Nor
rampir'd
town,
nor
castled
rock
afford
The
refuge
of
defence
from
Payo's
sword.
By
night-veil'd
art
proud
Sylves
falls
his
prey,
And
Tavila's
high,
walls,
at
middle
day,
Fearless
he
scales:
her
streets
in
blood
deplore
The
seven
brave
hunters
murder'd
by
the
Moor.[520]
These
three
bold
knights
how
dread![521]
Thro'
Spain
and
France
At
joust
and
tourney
with
the
tilted
lance
Victors
they
rode:
Castilia's
court
beheld
Her
peers
o'erthrown;
the
peers
with
rancour
swell'd:
The
bravest
of
the
three
their
swords
surround;
Brave
Ribeir
strews
them
vanquish'd
o'er
the
ground.
Now
let
thy
thoughts,
all
wonder
and
on
fire,
That
darling
son
of
warlike
Fame
admire.
Prostrate
at
proud
Castilia's
monarch's
feet
His
land
lies
trembling:
lo,
the
nobles
meet:
Softly
they
seem
to
breathe,
and
forward
bend
The
servile
neck;
each
eye
distrusts
his
friend;
Fearful
each
tongue
to
speak;
each
bosom
cold:
When,
colour'd
with
stern
rage,
erect
and
bold,
The
hero
rises:
'Here
no
foreign
throne
Shall
fix
its
base;
my
native
king
alone
Shall
reign.'
Then,
rushing
to
the
fight,
he
leads;
Low,
vanquish'd
in
the
dust,
Castilia
bleeds.
Where
proudest
hope
might
deem
it
vain
to
dare,
God
led
him
on,
and
crown'd
the
glorious
war.
Though
fierce,
as
num'rous,
are
the
hosts
that
dwell
By
Betis'
stream,
these
hosts
before
him
fell.
The
fight
behold:
while
absent
from
his
bands,
Press'd
on
the
step
of
flight
his
army
stands,
To
call
the
chief
a
herald
speeds
away:
Low,
on
his
knees,
the
gallant
chief
survey!
He
pours
his
soul,
with
lifted
hands
implores,
And
Heav'n's
assisting
arm,
inspir'd,
adores.
Panting,
and
pale,
the
herald
urges
speed:
With
holy
trust
of
victory
decreed,
Careless
he
answers,
'Nothing
urgent
calls:'
And
soon
the
bleeding
foe
before
him
falls.
To
Numa,
thus,
the
pale
patricians
fled--
'The
hostile
squadrons
o'er
the
kingdom
spread!'
They
cry;
unmov'd,
the
holy
king
replies--
'And
I,
behold,
am
off'ring
sacrifice!'[522]
Earnest,
I
see
thy
wond'ring
eyes
inquire
Who
this
illustrious
chief,
his
country's
sire?
The
Lusian
Scipio
well
might
speak
his
fame,
But
nobler
Nunio
shines
a
greater
name:[523]
On
earth's
green
bosom,
or
on
ocean
grey,
A
greater
never
shall
the
sun
survey.
"Known
by
the
silver
cross,
and
sable
shield,
Two
Knights
of
Malta[524]
there
command
the
field;
From
Tago's
banks
they
drive
the
fleecy
prey,
And
the
tir'd
ox
lows
on
his
weary
way:
When,
as
the
falcon
through
the
forest
glade
Darts
on
the
lev'ret,
from
the
brown-wood
shade
Darts
Roderic
on
their
rear;
in
scatter'd
flight
They
leave
the
goodly
herds
the
victor's
right.
Again,
behold,
in
gore
he
bathes
his
sword;
His
captive
friend,[525]
to
liberty
restor'd,
Glows
to
review
the
cause
that
wrought
his
woe,
The
cause,
his
loyalty,
as
taintless
snow.
Here
treason's
well-earn'd
meed
allures
thine
eyes,[526]
Low,
grovelling
in
the
dust,
the
traitor
dies;
Great
Elvas
gave
the
blow.
Again,
behold,
Chariot
and
steed
in
purple
slaughter
roll'd:
Great
Elvas
triumphs;
wide
o'er
Xeres'
plain
Around
him
reeks
the
noblest
blood
of
Spain.
"Here
Lisbon's
spacious
harbour
meets
the
view:
How
vast
the
foe's,
the
Lusian
fleet
how
few!
Castile's
proud
war-ships,
circling
round,
enclose
The
Lusian
galleys;
through
their
thund'ring
rows,
Fierce
pressing
on,
Pereira
fearless
rides,
His
hook'd
irons
grasp
the
adm'ral's
sides:
Confusion
maddens:
on
the
dreadless
knight
Castilia's
navy
pours
its
gather'd
might:
Pereira
dies,
their
self-devoted
prey,
And
safe
the
Lusian
galleys
speed
away.[527]
"Lo,
where

Twice

From

shepherd[528]
bore
The
leader's
staff
of
Lusus:
equal
flame
Inspir'd
these
few,[529]
their
victory
the
same.
Though
twenty
lances
brave
each
single
spear,
Never
the
foes
superior
might
to
fear
Is
our
inheritance,
our
native
right,
Well
tried,
well
prov'd
in

a
dreadful
fight.
"That
dauntless
earl
behold;
on
Libya's
coast,
Far
from
the
succour
of
the
Lusian
host,[530]
Twice
hard
besieg'd,
he
holds
the
Ceutan
towers
Against
the
banded
might
of
Afric's
powers.
That
other
earl;[531]--behold
the
port
he
bore,
So,
trod
stern
Mars
on
Thracia's
hills
of
yore.
What
groves
of
spears
Alcazar's
gates
surround!
There
Afric's
nations
blacken
o'er
the
ground.
A
thousand
ensigns,
glitt'ring
to
the
day,
The
waning
moon's
slant
silver
horns
display.
In
vain
their
rage;
no
gate,
no
turret
falls,
The
brave
De
Vian
guards
Alcazar's
walls.
In
hopeless
conflict
lost
his
king
appears;
Amid
the
thickest
of
the
Moorish
spears
Plunges
bold
Vian:
in
the
glorious
strife
He
dies,
and
dying
saves
his
sov'reign's
life.
"Illustrious,
lo,
two
brother-heroes
shine,[532]
Their
birth,
their
deeds,
adorn
the
royal
line;
To
ev'ry
king
of
princely
Europe
known,
In
ev'ry
court
the
gallant
Pedro
shone.
The
glorious
Henry[533]--kindling
at
his
name
Behold
my
sailors'
eyes
all
sparkle
flame!
Henry
the
chief,
who
first,
by
Heav'n
inspir'd,
To
deeds
unknown
before,
the
sailor
fir'd,
The
conscious
sailor
left
the
sight
of
shore,
And
dar'd
new
oceans,
never
plough'd
before.
The
various
wealth
of
ev'ry
distant
land
He
bade
his
fleets
explore,
his
fleets
command.
The
ocean's
great
discoverer
he
shines;
Nor
less
his
honours
in
the
martial
lines:
The
painted
flag
the
cloud-wrapt
siege
displays,
There
Ceuta's
rocking
wall
its
trust
betrays.
Black
yawns
the
breach;
the
point
of
many
a
spear
Gleams
through
the
smoke;
loud
shouts
astound
the
ear.
Whose
step
first
trod
the
dreadful
pass?
Whose
sword
Hew'd
its
dark
way,
first
with
the
foe
begor'd?
'Twas
thine,
O
glorious
Henry,
first
to
dare
The
dreadful
pass,
and
thine
to
close
the
war.
Taught
by
his
might,
and
humbled
in
her
gore,
The
boastful
pride
of
Afric
tower'd
no
more.
"Num'rous
though
these,
more
num'rous
warriors
shine
Th'
illustrious
glory
of
the
Lusian
line.
But
ah,
forlorn,
what
shame
to
barb'rous
pride![534]
Friendless
the
master
of
the
pencil
died;
Immortal
fame
his
deathless
labours
gave;
Poor
man,
he
sunk
neglected
to
the
grave!"
The
gallant
Paulus
faithful
thus
explain'd
The
various
deeds
the
pictur'd
flags
contain'd.
Still
o'er
and
o'er,
and
still
again
untir'd,
The
wond'ring
regent
of
the
wars
inquir'd:
Still
wond'ring,
heard
the
various
pleasing
tale,
Till
o'er
the
decks
cold
sigh'd
the
ev'ning
gale:
The
falling
darkness
dimm'd
the
eastern
shore,
And
twilight
hover'd
o'er
the
billows
hoar
Far
to
the
west,
when,
with
his
noble
band,
The
thoughtful
regent
sought
his
native
strand.
O'er
the
tall
mountain-forest's
waving
boughs
Aslant,
the
new
moon's
slender
horns
arose;
Near
her
pale
chariot
shone
a
twinkling
star,
And,
save
the
murm'ring
of
the
wave
afar,
Deep-brooding
silence
reign'd;
each
labour
clos'd,
In
sleep's
soft
arms
the
sons
of
toil
repos'd.
And
now,
no
more
the
moon
her
glimpses
shed,
A
sudden,
black-wing'd
cloud
the
sky
o'erspread,
A
sullen
murmur
through
the
woodland
groan'd,
In
woe-swoll'n
sighs
the
hollow
winds
bemoan'd:
Borne
on
the
plaintive
gale,
a
patt'ring
shower
Increas'd
the
horrors
of
the
evil
hour.
Thus,
when
the
God
of
earthquakes
rocks
the
ground,
He
gives
the
prelude
in
a
dreary
sound;
O'er
nature's
face
a
horrid
gloom
he
throws,
With
dismal
note
the
cock
unusual
crows,
A
shrill-voic'd
howling
trembles
thro'
the
air,
As
passing
ghosts
were
weeping
in
despair;
In
dismal
yells
the
dogs
confess
their
fear,
And
shiv'ring,
own
some
dreadful
presence
near.
So,
lower'd
the
night,
the
sullen
howl
the
same,
And,
'mid
the
black-wing'd
gloom,
stern
Bacchus
came;
The
form,
and
garb
of
Hagar's
son
he
took,
The
ghost-like
aspect,
and
the
threat'ning
look.[535]
Then,
o'er
the
pillow
of
a
furious
priest,
Whose
burning
zeal
the
Koran's
lore
profess'd,
Reveal'd
he
stood,
conspicuous
in
a
dream,
His
semblance
shining,
as
the
moon's
pale
gleam:
"And
guard,"
he
cries,
"my
son,
O
timely
guard,
Timely
defeat
the
dreadful
snare
prepar'd:
And
canst
thou,
careless,
unaffected,
sleep,
While
these
stern,
lawless
rovers
of
the
deep
Fix
on
thy
native
shore
a
foreign
throne,
Before
whose
steps
thy
latest
race
shall
groan!"
He
spoke;
cold
horror
shook
the
Moorish
priest;
He
wakes,
but
soon
reclines
in
wonted
rest:
An
airy
phantom
of
the
slumb'ring
brain
He
deem'd
the
vision;
when
the
fiend
again,
With
sterner
mien,
and
fiercer
accent
spoke:
"Oh
faithless!
worthy
of
the
foreign
yoke!
And
know'st
thou
not
thy
prophet
sent
by
Heav'n,
By
whom
the
Koran's
sacred
lore
was
giv'n,
God's
chiefest
gift
to
men:
and
must
I
leave
The
bowers
of
Paradise,
for
you
to
grieve,
For
you
to
watch,
while,
thoughtless
of
your
woe,
Ye
sleep,
the
careless
victims
of
the
foe;
The
foe,
whose
rage
will
soon
with
cruel
joy,
If
unoppos'd,
my
sacred
shrines
destroy?
Then,
while
kind
Heav'n
th'auspicious
hour
bestows,
Let
ev'ry
nerve
their
infant
strength
oppose.
When,
softly
usher'd
by
the
milky
dawn,
The
sun
first
rises[536]
o'er
the
daisied
lawn,
His
silver
lustre,
as
the
shining
dew
Of
radiance
mild,
unhurt
the
eye
may
view:
But,
when
on
high
the
noon-tide
flaming
rays
Give
all
the
force
of
living
fire
to
blaze,
A
giddy
darkness
strikes
the
conquer'd
sight,
That
dares,
in
all
his
glow,
the
lord
of
light.
Such,
if
on
India's
soil
the
tender
shoot
Of
these
proud
cedars
fix
the
stubborn
root,
Such,
shall
your
power
before
them
sink
decay'd.
And
India's
strength
shall
wither
in
their
shade."
He
spoke;
and,
instant
from
his
vot'ry's
bed
Together
with
repose,
the
demon
fled;
Again
cold
horror
shook
the
zealot's
frame,
And
all
his
hatred
of
Messiah's
name
Burn'd
in
his
venom'd
heart,
while,
veil'd
in
night,
Right
to
the
palace
sped
the
demon's
flight.
Sleepless
the
king
he
found,
in
dubious
thought;
His
conscious
fraud
a
thousand
terrors
brought:
All
gloomy
as
the
hour,
around
him
stand,
With
haggard
looks,
the
hoary
Magi
band:[537]
To
trace
what
fates
on
India's
wide
domain
Attend
the
rovers
from
unheard-of
Spain,
Prepar'd,
in
dark
futurity,
to
prove
The
hell-taught
rituals
of
infernal
Jove:
Mutt'ring
their
charms,
and
spells
of
dreary
sound,
With
naked
feet
they
beat
the
hollow
ground;
Blue
gleams
the
altar's
flame
along
the
walls,
With
dismal,
hollow
groans
the
victim
falls;
With
earnest
eyes
the
priestly
band
explore
The
entrails,
throbbing
in
the
living
gore.
And
lo,
permitted
by
the
power
divine,
The
hov'ring
demon
gives
the
dreadful
sign.[538]
Here
furious
War
her
gleamy
falchion
draws,
Here
lean-ribb'd
Famine
writhes
her
falling
jaws;
Dire
as
the
fiery
pestilential
star
Darting
his
eyes,
high
on
his
trophied
car,
Stern
Tyranny
sweeps
wide
o'er
India's
ground;
On
vulture-wings
fierce
Rapine
hovers
round;
Ills
after
ills,
and
India's
fetter'd
might,
Th'eternal
yoke.[539]
Loud
shrieking
at
the
sight,
The
starting
wizards
from
the
altar
fly,
And
silent
horror
glares
in
ev'ry
eye:
Pale
stands
the
monarch,
lost
in
cold
dismay,
And,
now
impatient,
waits
the
ling'ring
day.
With
gloomy
aspect
rose
the
ling'ring
dawn,
And
dropping
tears
flow'd
slowly
o'er
the
lawn;
The
Moorish
priest,
with
fear
and
vengeance
fraught,
Soon
as
the
light
appear'd
his
kindred
sought;
Appall'd,
and
trembling
with
ungen'rous
fear,
In
secret
council
met,
his
tale
they
hear;
As,
check'd
by
terror
or
impell'd
by
hate,
Of
various
means
they
ponder
and
debate,
Against
the
Lusian
train
what
arts
employ,
By
force
to
slaughter,
or
by
fraud
destroy;
Now
black,
now
pale,
their
bearded
cheeks
appear,
As
boiling
rage
prevails,
or
boding
fear;
Beneath
their
shady
brows,
their
eye-balls
roll,
Nor
one
soft
gleam
bespeaks
the
gen'rous
soul;
Through
quiv'ring
lips
they
draw
their
panting
breath.
While
their
dark
fraud
decrees
the
works
of
death;
Nor
unresolv'd
the
power
of
gold
to
try
Swift
to
the
lordly
catual's
gate
they
hie.--
Ah,
what
the
wisdom,
what
the
sleepless
care
Efficient
to
avoid
the
traitor's
snare;
What
human
power
can
give
a
king
to
know
The
smiling
aspect
of
the
lurking
foe!
So
let
the
tyrant
plead.[540]--The
patriot
king
Knows
men,
knows
whence
the
patriot
virtues
spring;
From
inward
worth,
from
conscience
firm
and
bold,
(Not
from
the
man
whose
honest
name
is
sold),
He
hopes
that
virtue,
whose
unalter'd
weight
Stands
fix'd,
unveering
with
the
storms
of
state.
Lur'd
was
the
regent
with
the
Moorish
gold,
And
now
agreed
their
fraudful
course
to
hold,
Swift
to
the
king
the
regent's
steps
they
tread;
The
king
they
found
o'erwhelm'd
in
sacred
dread.
The
word
they
take,
their
ancient
deeds
relate,
Their
ever
faithful
service
of
the
state;[541]
"For
ages
long,
from
shore
to
distant
shore
For
thee
our
ready
keels
the
traffic
bore:
For
thee
we
dar'd
each
horror
of
the
wave;
Whate'er
thy
treasures
boast
our
labours
gave.
And
wilt
thou
now
confer
our
long-earn'd
due,
Confer
thy
favour
on
a
lawless
crew?
The
race
they
boast,
as
tigers
of
the
wold
Bear
that
proud
sway,
by
justice
uncontroll'd.
Yet,
for
their
crimes,
expell'd
that
bloody
home,
These,
o'er
the
deep,
rapacious
plund'rers
roam.
Their
deeds
we
know;
round
Afric's
shores
they
came,
And
spread,
where'er
they
pass'd,
devouring
flame;
Mozambique's
towers,
enroll'd
in
sheets
of
fire,
Blaz'd
to
the
sky,
her
own
funereal
pyre.
Imperial
Calicut
shall
feel
the
same,
And
these
proud
state-rooms
feed
the
funeral
flame;
While
many
a
league
far
round,
their
joyful
eyes
Shall
mark
old
ocean
reddening
to
the
skies.
Such
dreadful
fates,
o'er
thee,
O
king,
depend,
Yet,
with
thy
fall
our
fate
shall
never
blend:
Ere
o'er
the
east
arise
the
second
dawn
Our
fleets,
our
nation
from
thy
land
withdrawn,
In
other
climes,
beneath
a
kinder
reign
Shall
fix
their
port:
yet
may
the
threat
be
vain!
If
wiser
thou
with
us
thy
powers
employ,
Soon
shall
our
powers
the
robber-crew
destroy.
By
their
own
arts
and
secret
deeds
o'ercome,
Here
shall
they
meet
the
fate
escaped
at
home."
While
thus
the
priest
detain'd
the
monarch's
ear,
His
cheeks
confess'd
the
quiv'ring
pulse
of
fear.
Unconscious
of
the
worth
that
fires
the
brave,
In
state
a
monarch,
but
in
heart
a
slave,
He
view'd
brave
VASCO,
and
his
gen'rous
train,
As
his
own
passions
stamp'd
the
conscious
stain:
Nor
less
his
rage
the
fraudful
regent
fir'd;
And
valiant
GAMA'S
fate
was
now
conspir'd.
Ambassadors
from
India
GAMA
sought,
And
oaths
of
peace,
for
oaths
of
friendship
brought;
The
glorious
tale,
'twas
all
he
wish'd,
to
tell;
So
Ilion's[542]
fate
was
seal'd
when
Hector
fell.
Again
convok'd
before
the
Indian
throne,
The
monarch
meets
him
with
a
rageful
frown;
"And
own,"
he
cries,
"the
naked
truth
reveal,
Then
shall
my
bounteous
grace
thy
pardon
seal.
Feign'd
is
the
treaty
thou
pretend'st
to
bring:
No
country
owns
thee,
and
thou
own'st
no
king.
Thy
life,
long
roving
o'er
the
deep,
I
know--
A
lawless
robber,
every
man
thy
foe.
And
think'st
thou
credit
to
thy
tale
to
gain?
Mad
were
the
sov'reign,
and
the
hope
were
vain,
Through
ways
unknown,
from
utmost
western
shore,
To
bid
his
fleets
the
utmost
east
explore.
Great
is
thy
monarch,
so
thy
words
declare;
But
sumptuous
gifts
the
proof
of
greatness
bear:
Kings
thus
to
kings
their
empire's
grandeur
show;
Thus
prove
thy
truth,
thus
we
thy
truth
allow.
If
not,
what
credence
will
the
wise
afford?
What
monarch
trust
the
wand'ring
seaman's
word?
No
sumptuous
gift
thou
bring'st.[543]--Yet,
though
some
crime
Has
thrown
thee,
banish'd
from
thy
native
clime,
(Such
oft
of
old
the
hero's
fate
has
been),
Here
end
thy
toils,
nor
tempt
new
fates
unseen:
Each
land
the
brave
man
nobly
calls
his
home:
Or
if,
bold
pirates,
o'er
the
deep
you
roam,
Skill'd
the
dread
storm
to
brave,
O
welcome
here!
Fearless
of
death,
or
shame,
confess
sincere:
My
name
shall
then
thy
dread
protection
be,
My
captain
thou,
unrivall'd
on
the
sea."
Oh
now,
ye
Muses,
sing
what
goddess
fir'd
GAMA'S
proud
bosom,
and
his
lips
inspir'd.
Fair
Acidalia,
love's
celestial
queen,[544]
The
graceful
goddess
of
the
fearless
mien,
Her
graceful
freedom
on
his
look
bestow'd,
And
all
collected
in
his
bosom
glow'd.
"Sov'reign,"
he
cries,
"oft
witness'd,
well
I
know
The
rageful
falsehood
of
the
Moorish
foe:
Their
fraudful
tales,
from
hatred
bred,
believ'd,
Thine
ear
is
poison'd,
and
thine
eye
deceiv'd.
What
light,
what
shade
the
courtier's
mirror
gives,
That
light,
that
shade
the
guarded
king
receives.
Me
hast
thou
view'd
in
colours
not
mine
own,
Yet,
bold
I
promise
shall
my
truth
be
known.
If
o'er
the
seas
a
lawless
pest
I
roam,
A
blood-stain'd
exile
from
my
native
home,
How
many
a
fertile
shore
and
beauteous
isle,
Where
Nature's
gifts,
unclaim'd,
unbounded,
smile,
Mad
have
I
left,
to
dare
the
burning
zone,
And
all
the
horrors
of
the
gulfs
unknown
That
roar
beneath
the
axle
of
the
world.
Where
ne'er
before
was
daring
sail
unfurl'd!
And
have
I
left
these
beauteous
shores
behind,
And
have
I
dar'd
the
rage
of
ev'ry
wind,
That
now
breath'd
fire,
and
now
came
wing'd
with
frost,
Lur'd
by
the
plunder
of
an
unknown
coast?
Not
thus
the
robber
leaves
his
certain
prey
For
the
gay
promise
of
a
nameless
day.
Dread
and
stupendous,
more
than
death-doom'd
man
Might
hope
to
compass,
more
than
wisdom
plan,
To
thee
my
toils,
to
thee
my
dangers
rise:
Ah!
Lisbon's
kings
behold
with
other
eyes.
Where
virtue
calls,
where
glory
leads
the
way,
No
dangers
move
them,
and
no
toils
dismay.
Long
have
the
kings
of
Lusus'
daring
race
Resolv'd
the
limits
of
the
deep
to
trace,
Beneath
the
morn
to
ride
the
furthest
waves,
And
pierce
the
farthest
shore
old
Ocean
laves.
Sprung
from
the
prince,[545]
before
whose
matchless
power
The
strength
of
Afric
wither'd
as
a
flower
Never

Henry
shone,
Each

his

Bold
as

To

Indian
shore
his
pride
aspir'd.
Beneath
the
stars
that
round
the
Hydra
shine,
And
where
fam'd
Argo
hangs
the
heav'nly
sign,
Where
thirst
and
fever
burn
on
ev'ry
gale
The
dauntless
Henry
rear'd
the
Lusian
sail.
Embolden'd
by
the
meed
that
crown'd
his
toils,
Beyond
the
wide-spread
shores
and
num'rous
isles,
Where
both
the
tropics
pour
the
burning
day,
Succeeding
heroes
forc'd
th'
exploring
way;
That
race
which
never
view'd
the
Pleiad's
car,
That
barb'rous
race
beneath
the
southern
star,
Their
eyes
beheld.--Dread
roar'd
the
blast--the
wave
Boils
to
the
sky,
the
meeting
whirlwinds
rave
O'er
the
torn
heav'ns;
loud
on
their
awe-struck
ear
Great
Nature
seem'd
to
call,
'Approach
not
here!'
At
Lisbon's
court
they
told
their
dread
escape,
And
from
her
raging
tempests,
nam'd
the
Cape.[546]
'Thou
southmost
point,'
the
joyful
king
exclaim'd,
'Cape
of
Good
Hope,
be
thou
for
ever
nam'd!
Onward
my
fleets
shall
dare
the
dreadful
way,
And
find
the
regions
of
the
infant
day.'
In
vain
the
dark
and
ever-howling
blast
Proclaim'd,
'This
ocean
never
shall
be
past;'
Through
that
dread
ocean,
and
the
tempests'
roar,
My
king
commanded,
and
my
course
I
bore.
The
pillar
thus
of
deathless
fame,
begun
By
other
chiefs,[547]
beneath
the
rising
sun
In
thy
great
realm,
now
to
the
skies
I
raise,
The
deathless
pillar
of
my
nation's
praise.
Through
these
wild
seas
no
costly
gift
I
brought;
Thy
shore
alone
and
friendly
peace
I
sought.
And
yet
to
thee
the
noblest
gift
I
bring
The
world
can
boast--the
friendship
of
my
king.
And
mark
the
word,
his
greatness
shall
appear
When
next
my
course
to
India's
strand
I
steer,
Such
proofs
I'll
bring
as
never
man
before
In
deeds
of
strife,
or
peaceful
friendship
bore.
Weigh
now
my
words,
my
truth
demands
the
light,
For
truth
shall
ever
boast,
at
last,
resistless
might."
